# Typey Type Data

This project contains data for [Typey Type](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type), a free typing app designed for steno students to practise and master stenography.

## Sponsor

You can support [Di’s efforts on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/didoesdigital). A monthly donation helps Di build more lessons and features to help you fast-track your steno progress.

## Contributing lessons or dictionaries

To contribute lessons or dictionaries, see the [Typey Type CLI](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type-cli) repo instead.

*This* repo contains the results of automated scripts from the CLI that transform Typey Type’s [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) and other data to produce the files in this repo.

You can **create issues** for lesson ideas or inaccurate data. See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

## Steno dictionaries git submodule

Historically this repo has contained the [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) submodule but it is moving to [Typey Type CLI](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type-cli). If you've been using the paths to these dictionaries in Plover, for example, you may need to update them to look in the CLI or somewhere standalone.
