MOTHER HOLLE
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
widow
who
had
two
daughters;
one
of
them
was
beautiful
and
industrious,
the
other
ugly
and
lazy.
The
mother,
however,
loved
the
ugly
and
lazy
one
best,
because
she
was
her
own
daughter,
and
so
the
other,
who
was
only
her
stepdaughter,
was
made
to
do
all
the
work
of
the
house,
and
was
quite
the
Cinderella
of
the
family.
Her
stepmother
sent
her
out
every
day
to
sit
by
the
well
in
the
high
road,
there
to
spin
until
she
made
her
fingers
bleed.
Now
it
chanced
one
day
that
some
blood
fell
on
to
the
spindle,
and
as
the
girl
stopped
over
the
well
to
wash
it
off,
the
spindle
suddenly
sprang
out
of
her
hand
and
fell
into
the
well.
She
ran
home
crying
to
tell
of
her
misfortune,
but
her
stepmother
spoke
harshly
to
her,
and
after
giving
her
a
violent
scolding,
said
unkindly,
'As
you
have
let
the
spindle
fall
into
the
well
you
may
go
yourself
and
fetch
it
out.'
The
girl
went
back
to
the
well
not
knowing
what
to
do,
and
at
last
in
her
distress
she
jumped
into
the
water
after
the
spindle.
She
remembered
nothing
more
until
she
awoke
and
found
herself
in
a
beautiful
meadow,
full
of
sunshine,
and
with
countless
flowers
blooming
in
every
direction.
She
walked
over
the
meadow,
and
presently
she
came
upon
a
baker's
oven
full
of
bread,
and
the
loaves
cried
out
to
her,
'Take
us
out,
take
us
out,
or
alas!
we
shall
be
burnt
to
a
cinder;
we
were
baked
through
long
ago.'
So
she
took
the
bread-shovel
and
drew
them
all
out.
She
went
on
a
little
farther,
till
she
came
to
a
tree
full
of
apples.
'Shake
me,
shake
me,
I
pray,'
cried
the
tree;
'my
apples,
one
and
all,
are
ripe.'
So
she
shook
the
tree,
and
the
apples
came
falling
down
upon
her
like
rain;
but
she
continued
shaking
until
there
was
not
a
single
apple
left
upon
it.
Then
she
carefully
gathered
the
apples
together
in
a
heap
and
walked
on
again.
The
next
thing
she
came
to
was
a
little
house,
and
there
she
saw
an
old
woman
looking
out,
with
such
large
teeth,
that
she
was
terrified,
and
turned
to
run
away.
But
the
old
woman
called
after
her,
'What
are
you
afraid
of,
dear
child?
Stay
with
me;
if
you
will
do
the
work
of
my
house
properly
for
me,
I
will
make
you
very
happy.
You
must
be
very
careful,
however,
to
make
my
bed
in
the
right
way,
for
I
wish
you
always
to
shake
it
thoroughly,
so
that
the
feathers
fly
about;
then
they
say,
down
there
in
the
world,
that
it
is
snowing;
for
I
am
Mother
Holle.'
The
old
woman
spoke
so
kindly,
that
the
girl
summoned
up
courage
and
agreed
to
enter
into
her
service.
She
took
care
to
do
everything
according
to
the
old
woman's
bidding
and
every
time
she
made
the
bed
she
shook
it
with
all
her
might,
so
that
the
feathers
flew
about
like
so
many
snowflakes.
The
old
woman
was
as
good
as
her
word:
she
never
spoke
angrily
to
her,
and
gave
her
roast
and
boiled
meats
every
day.
So
she
stayed
on
with
Mother
Holle
for
some
time,
and
then
she
began
to
grow
unhappy.
She
could
not
at
first
tell
why
she
felt
sad,
but
she
became
conscious
at
last
of
great
longing
to
go
home;
then
she
knew
she
was
homesick,
although
she
was
a
thousand
times
better
off
with
Mother
Holle
than
with
her
mother
and
sister.
After
waiting
awhile,
she
went
to
Mother
Holle
and
said,
'I
am
so
homesick,
that
I
cannot
stay
with
you
any
longer,
for
although
I
am
so
happy
here,
I
must
return
to
my
own
people.'
Then
Mother
Holle
said,
'I
am
pleased
that
you
should
want
to
go
back
to
your
own
people,
and
as
you
have
served
me
so
well
and
faithfully,
I
will
take
you
home
myself.'
Thereupon
she
led
the
girl
by
the
hand
up
to
a
broad
gateway.
The
gate
was
opened,
and
as
the
girl
passed
through,
a
shower
of
gold
fell
upon
her,
and
the
gold
clung
to
her,
so
that
she
was
covered
with
it
from
head
to
foot.
'That
is
a
reward
for
your
industry,'
said
Mother
Holle,
and
as
she
spoke
she
handed
her
the
spindle
which
she
had
dropped
into
the
well.
The
gate
was
then
closed,
and
the
girl
found
herself
back
in
the
old
world
close
to
her
mother's
house.
As
she
entered
the
courtyard,
the
cock
who
was
perched
on
the
well,
called
out:
'Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Your
golden
daughter's
come
back
to
you.'
Then
she
went
in
to
her
mother
and
sister,
and
as
she
was
so
richly
covered
with
gold,
they
gave
her
a
warm
welcome.
She
related
to
them
all
that
had
happened,
and
when
the
mother
heard
how
she
had
come
by
her
great
riches,
she
thought
she
should
like
her
ugly,
lazy
daughter
to
go
and
try
her
fortune.
So
she
made
the
sister
go
and
sit
by
the
well
and
spin,
and
the
girl
pricked
her
finger
and
thrust
her
hand
into
a
thorn-bush,
so
that
she
might
drop
some
blood
on
to
the
spindle;
then
she
threw
it
into
the
well,
and
jumped
in
herself.
Like
her
sister
she
awoke
in
the
beautiful
meadow,
and
walked
over
it
till
she
came
to
the
oven.
'Take
us
out,
take
us
out,
or
alas!
we
shall
be
burnt
to
a
cinder;
we
were
baked
through
long
ago,'
cried
the
loaves
as
before.
But
the
lazy
girl
answered,
'Do
you
think
I
am
going
to
dirty
my
hands
for
you?'
and
walked
on.
Presently
she
came
to
the
apple-tree.
'Shake
me,
shake
me,
I
pray;
my
apples,
one
and
all,
are
ripe,'
it
cried.
But
she
only
answered,
'A
nice
thing
to
ask
me
to
do,
one
of
the
apples
might
fall
on
my
head,'
and
passed
on.
At
last
she
came
to
Mother
Holle's
house,
and
as
she
had
heard
all
about
the
large
teeth
from
her
sister,
she
was
not
afraid
of
them,
and
engaged
herself
without
delay
to
the
old
woman.
The
first
day
she
was
very
obedient
and
industrious,
and
exerted
herself
to
please
Mother
Holle,
for
she
thought
of
the
gold
she
should
get
in
return.
The
next
day,
however,
she
began
to
dawdle
over
her
work,
and
the
third
day
she
was
more
idle
still;
then
she
began
to
lie
in
bed
in
the
mornings
and
refused
to
get
up.
Worse
still,
she
neglected
to
make
the
old
woman's
bed
properly,
and
forgot
to
shake
it
so
that
the
feathers
might
fly
about.
So
Mother
Holle
very
soon
got
tired
of
her,
and
told
her
she
might
go.
The
lazy
girl
was
delighted
at
this,
and
thought
to
herself,
'The
gold
will
soon
be
mine.'
Mother
Holle
led
her,
as
she
had
led
her
sister,
to
the
broad
gateway;
but
as
she
was
passing
through,
instead
of
the
shower
of
gold,
a
great
bucketful
of
pitch
came
pouring
over
her.
'That
is
in
return
for
your
services,'
said
the
old
woman,
and
she
shut
the
gate.
So
the
lazy
girl
had
to
go
home
covered
with
pitch,
and
the
cock
on
the
well
called
out
as
she
saw
her:
'Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Your
dirty
daughter's
come
back
to
you.'
But,
try
what
she
would,
she
could
not
get
the
pitch
off
and
it
stuck
to
her
as
long
as
she
lived.
LITTLE
RED-CAP
[LITTLE
RED
RIDING
HOOD]
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
dear
little
girl
who
was
loved
by
everyone
who
looked
at
her,
but
most
of
all
by
her
grandmother,
and
there
was
nothing
that
she
would
not
have
given
to
the
child.
Once
she
gave
her
a
little
cap
of
red
velvet,
which
suited
her
so
well
that
she
would
never
wear
anything
else;
so
she
was
always
called
'Little
Red-Cap.'
One
day
her
mother
said
to
her:
'Come,
Little
Red-Cap,
here
is
a
piece
of
cake
and
a
bottle
of
wine;
take
them
to
your
grandmother,
she
is
ill
and
weak,
and
they
will
do
her
good.
Set
out
before
it
gets
hot,
and
when
you
are
going,
walk
nicely
and
quietly
and
do
not
run
off
the
path,
or
you
may
fall
and
break
the
bottle,
and
then
your
grandmother
will
get
nothing;
and
when
you
go
into
her
room,
don't
forget
to
say,
"Good
morning",
and
don't
peep
into
every
corner
before
you
do
it.'
'I
will
take
great
care,'
said
Little
Red-Cap
to
her
mother,
and
gave
her
hand
on
it.
The
grandmother
lived
out
in
the
wood,
half
a
league
from
the
village,
and
just
as
Little
Red-Cap
entered
the
wood,
a
wolf
met
her.
Red-Cap
did
not
know
what
a
wicked
creature
he
was,
and
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
him.
'Good
day,
Little
Red-Cap,'
said
he.
'Thank
you
kindly,
wolf.'
'Whither
away
so
early,
Little
Red-Cap?'
'To
my
grandmother's.'
'What
have
you
got
in
your
apron?'
'Cake
and
wine;
yesterday
was
baking-day,
so
poor
sick
grandmother
is
to
have
something
good,
to
make
her
stronger.'
'Where
does
your
grandmother
live,
Little
Red-Cap?'
'A
good
quarter
of
a
league
farther
on
in
the
wood;
her
house
stands
under
the
three
large
oak-trees,
the
nut-trees
are
just
below;
you
surely
must
know
it,'
replied
Little
Red-Cap.
The
wolf
thought
to
himself:
'What
a
tender
young
creature!
what
a
nice
plump
mouthful--she
will
be
better
to
eat
than
the
old
woman.
I
must
act
craftily,
so
as
to
catch
both.'
So
he
walked
for
a
short
time
by
the
side
of
Little
Red-Cap,
and
then
he
said:
'See,
Little
Red-Cap,
how
pretty
the
flowers
are
about
here--why
do
you
not
look
round?
I
believe,
too,
that
you
do
not
hear
how
sweetly
the
little
birds
are
singing;
you
walk
gravely
along
as
if
you
were
going
to
school,
while
everything
else
out
here
in
the
wood
is
merry.'
Little
Red-Cap
raised
her
eyes,
and
when
she
saw
the
sunbeams
dancing
here
and
there
through
the
trees,
and
pretty
flowers
growing
everywhere,
she
thought:
'Suppose
I
take
grandmother
a
fresh
nosegay;
that
would
please
her
too.
It
is
so
early
in
the
day
that
I
shall
still
get
there
in
good
time';
and
so
she
ran
from
the
path
into
the
wood
to
look
for
flowers.
And
whenever
she
had
picked
one,
she
fancied
that
she
saw
a
still
prettier
one
farther
on,
and
ran
after
it,
and
so
got
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood.
Meanwhile
the
wolf
ran
straight
to
the
grandmother's
house
and
knocked
at
the
door.
'Who
is
there?'
'Little
Red-Cap,'
replied
the
wolf.
'She
is
bringing
cake
and
wine;
open
the
door.'
'Lift
the
latch,'
called
out
the
grandmother,
'I
am
too
weak,
and
cannot
get
up.'
The
wolf
lifted
the
latch,
the
door
sprang
open,
and
without
saying
a
word
he
went
straight
to
the
grandmother's
bed,
and
devoured
her.
Then
he
put
on
her
clothes,
dressed
himself
in
her
cap
laid
himself
in
bed
and
drew
the
curtains.
Little
Red-Cap,
however,
had
been
running
about
picking
flowers,
and
when
she
had
gathered
so
many
that
she
could
carry
no
more,
she
remembered
her
grandmother,
and
set
out
on
the
way
to
her.
She
was
surprised
to
find
the
cottage-door
standing
open,
and
when
she
went
into
the
room,
she
had
such
a
strange
feeling
that
she
said
to
herself:
'Oh
dear!
how
uneasy
I
feel
today,
and
at
other
times
I
like
being
with
grandmother
so
much.'
She
called
out:
'Good
morning,'
but
received
no
answer;
so
she
went
to
the
bed
and
drew
back
the
curtains.
There
lay
her
grandmother
with
her
cap
pulled
far
over
her
face,
and
looking
very
strange.
'Oh!
grandmother,'
she
said,
'what
big
ears
you
have!'
'The
better
to
hear
you
with,
my
child,'
was
the
reply.
'But,
grandmother,
what
big
eyes
you
have!'
she
said.
'The
better
to
see
you
with,
my
dear.'
'But,
grandmother,
what
large
hands
you
have!'
'The
better
to
hug
you
with.'
'Oh!
but,
grandmother,
what
a
terrible
big
mouth
you
have!'
'The
better
to
eat
you
with!'
And
scarcely
had
the
wolf
said
this,
than
with
one
bound
he
was
out
of
bed
and
swallowed
up
Red-Cap.
When
the
wolf
had
appeased
his
appetite,
he
lay
down
again
in
the
bed,
fell
asleep
and
began
to
snore
very
loud.
The
huntsman
was
just
passing
the
house,
and
thought
to
himself:
'How
the
old
woman
is
snoring!
I
must
just
see
if
she
wants
anything.'
So
he
went
into
the
room,
and
when
he
came
to
the
bed,
he
saw
that
the
wolf
was
lying
in
it.
'Do
I
find
you
here,
you
old
sinner!'
said
he.
'I
have
long
sought
you!'
Then
just
as
he
was
going
to
fire
at
him,
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
wolf
might
have
devoured
the
grandmother,
and
that
she
might
still
be
saved,
so
he
did
not
fire,
but
took
a
pair
of
scissors,
and
began
to
cut
open
the
stomach
of
the
sleeping
wolf.
When
he
had
made
two
snips,
he
saw
the
little
Red-Cap
shining,
and
then
he
made
two
snips
more,
and
the
little
girl
sprang
out,
crying:
'Ah,
how
frightened
I
have
been!
How
dark
it
was
inside
the
wolf';
and
after
that
the
aged
grandmother
came
out
alive
also,
but
scarcely
able
to
breathe.
Red-Cap,
however,
quickly
fetched
great
stones
with
which
they
filled
the
wolf's
belly,
and
when
he
awoke,
he
wanted
to
run
away,
but
the
stones
were
so
heavy
that
he
collapsed
at
once,
and
fell
dead.
Then
all
three
were
delighted.
The
huntsman
drew
off
the
wolf's
skin
and
went
home
with
it;
the
grandmother
ate
the
cake
and
drank
the
wine
which
Red-Cap
had
brought,
and
revived,
but
Red-Cap
thought
to
herself:
'As
long
as
I
live,
I
will
never
by
myself
leave
the
path,
to
run
into
the
wood,
when
my
mother
has
forbidden
me
to
do
so.'
It
also
related
that
once
when
Red-Cap
was
again
taking
cakes
to
the
old
grandmother,
another
wolf
spoke
to
her,
and
tried
to
entice
her
from
the
path.
Red-Cap,
however,
was
on
her
guard,
and
went
straight
forward
on
her
way,
and
told
her
grandmother
that
she
had
met
the
wolf,
and
that
he
had
said
'good
morning'
to
her,
but
with
such
a
wicked
look
in
his
eyes,
that
if
they
had
not
been
on
the
public
road
she
was
certain
he
would
have
eaten
her
up.
'Well,'
said
the
grandmother,
'we
will
shut
the
door,
that
he
may
not
come
in.'
Soon
afterwards
the
wolf
knocked,
and
cried:
'Open
the
door,
grandmother,
I
am
Little
Red-Cap,
and
am
bringing
you
some
cakes.'
But
they
did
not
speak,
or
open
the
door,
so
the
grey-beard
stole
twice
or
thrice
round
the
house,
and
at
last
jumped
on
the
roof,
intending
to
wait
until
Red-Cap
went
home
in
the
evening,
and
then
to
steal
after
her
and
devour
her
in
the
darkness.
But
the
grandmother
saw
what
was
in
his
thoughts.
In
front
of
the
house
was
a
great
stone
trough,
so
she
said
to
the
child:
'Take
the
pail,
Red-Cap;
I
made
some
sausages
yesterday,
so
carry
the
water
in
which
I
boiled
them
to
the
trough.'
Red-Cap
carried
until
the
great
trough
was
quite
full.
Then
the
smell
of
the
sausages
reached
the
wolf,
and
he
sniffed
and
peeped
down,
and
at
last
stretched
out
his
neck
so
far
that
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
footing
and
began
to
slip,
and
slipped
down
from
the
roof
straight
into
the
great
trough,
and
was
drowned.
But
Red-Cap
went
joyously
home,
and
no
one
ever
did
anything
to
harm
her
again.
