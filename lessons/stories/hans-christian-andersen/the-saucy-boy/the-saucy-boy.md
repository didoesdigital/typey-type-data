THE SAUCY BOY
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
an
old
poet,
one
of
those
right
good
old
poets.
One
evening,
as
he
was
sitting
at
home,
there
was
a
terrible
storm
going
on
outside;
the
rain
was
pouring
down,
but
the
old
poet
sat
comfortably
in
his
chimney-corner,
where
the
fire
was
burning
and
the
apples
were
roasting.
"There
will
not
be
a
dry
thread
left
on
the
poor
people
who
are
out
in
this
weather,"
he
said.
"Oh,
open
the
door!
I
am
so
cold
and
wet
through,"
called
a
little
child
outside.
It
was
crying
and
knocking
at
the
door,
whilst
the
rain
was
pouring
down
and
the
wind
was
rattling
all
the
windows.
"Poor
creature!"
said
the
poet,
and
got
up
and
opened
the
door.
Before
him
stood
a
little
boy;
he
was
naked,
and
the
water
flowed
from
his
long
fair
locks.
He
was
shivering
with
cold;
if
he
had
not
been
let
in,
he
would
certainly
have
perished
in
the
storm.
"Poor
little
thing!"
said
the
poet,
and
took
him
by
the
hand.
"Come
to
me;
I
will
soon
warm
you.
You
shall
have
some
wine
and
an
apple,
for
you
are
such
a
pretty
boy."
And
he
was,
too.
His
eyes
sparkled
like
two
bright
stars,
and
although
the
water
flowed
down
from
his
fair
locks,
they
still
curled
quite
beautifully.
He
looked
like
a
little
angel,
but
was
pale
with
cold,
and
trembling
all
over.
In
his
hand
he
held
a
splendid
bow,
but
it
had
been
entirely
spoilt
by
the
rain,
and
the
colours
of
the
pretty
arrows
had
run
into
one
another
by
getting
wet.
The
old
man
sat
down
by
the
fire,
and
taking
the
little
boy
on
his
knee,
wrung
the
water
out
of
his
locks
and
warmed
his
hands
in
his
own.
He
then
made
him
some
hot
spiced
wine,
which
quickly
revived
him;
so
that
with
reddening
cheeks,
he
sprang
upon
the
floor
and
danced
around
the
old
man.
"You
are
a
merry
boy,"
said
the
latter.
"What
is
your
name?"
"My
name
is
Cupid,"
he
answered.
"Don't
you
know
me?
There
lies
my
bow.
I
shoot
with
that,
you
know.
Look,
the
weather
is
getting
fine
again—the
moon
is
shining."
"But
your
bow
is
spoilt,"
said
the
old
poet.
"That
would
be
unfortunate,"
said
the
little
boy,
taking
it
up
and
looking
at
it.
"Oh,
it's
quite
dry
and
isn't
damaged
at
all.
The
string
is
quite
tight;
I'll
try
it."
So,
drawing
it
back,
he
took
an
arrow,
aimed,
and
shot
the
good
old
poet
right
in
the
heart.
"Do
you
see
now
that
my
bow
was
not
spoilt?"
he
said,
and,
loudly
laughing,
ran
away.
What
a
naughty
boy
to
shoot
the
old
poet
like
that,
who
had
taken
him
into
his
warm
room,
had
been
so
good
to
him,
and
had
given
him
the
nicest
wine
and
the
best
apple!
The
good
old
man
lay
upon
the
floor
crying;
he
was
really
shot
in
the
heart.
"Oh!"
he
cried,
"what
a
naughty
boy
this
Cupid
is!
I
shall
tell
all
the
good
children
about
this,
so
that
they
take
care
never
to
play
with
him,
lest
he
hurt
them."
And
all
good
children,
both
girls
and
boys,
whom
he
told
about
this,
were
on
their
guard
against
wicked
Cupid;
but
he
deceives
them
all
the
same,
for
he
is
very
deep.
When
the
students
come
out
of
class,
he
walks
beside
them
with
a
book
under
his
arm,
and
wearing
a
black
coat.
They
cannot
recognise
him.
And
then,
if
they
take
him
by
the
arm,
believing
him
to
be
a
student
too,
he
sticks
an
arrow
into
their
chest.
And
when
the
girls
go
to
church
to
be
confirmed,
he
is
amongst
them
too.
In
fact,
he
is
always
after
people.
He
sits
in
the
large
chandelier
in
the
theatre
and
blazes
away,
so
that
people
think
it
is
a
lamp;
but
they
soon
find
out
their
mistake.
He
walks
about
in
the
castle
garden
and
on
the
promenades.
Yes,
once
he
shot
your
father
and
your
mother
in
the
heart
too.
Just
ask
them,
and
you
will
hear
what
they
say.
Oh!
he
is
a
bad
boy,
this
Cupid,
and
you
must
never
have
anything
to
do
with
him,
for
he
is
after
every
one.
Just
think,
he
even
shot
an
arrow
at
old
grandmother;
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago.
The
wound
has
long
been
healed,
but
such
things
are
never
forgotten.
Now
you
know
what
a
bad
boy
this
wicked
Cupid
is.
