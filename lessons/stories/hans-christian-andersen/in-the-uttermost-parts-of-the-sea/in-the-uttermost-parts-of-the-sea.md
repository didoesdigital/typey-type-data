IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE SEA
Some
years
ago,
large
ships
were
sent
towards
the
north
pole,
to
explore
the
distant
coasts,
and
to
try
how
far
men
could
penetrate
into
those
unknown
regions.
For
more
than
a
year
one
of
these
ships
had
been
pushing
its
way
northward,
amid
snow
and
ice,
and
the
sailors
had
endured
many
hardships;
till
at
length
winter
set
in,
and
the
sun
entirely
disappeared;
for
many
weeks
there
would
be
constant
night.
All
around,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach,
nothing
could
be
seen
but
fields
of
ice,
in
which
the
ship
remained
stuck
fast.
The
snow
lay
piled
up
in
great
heaps,
and
of
these
the
sailors
made
huts,
in
the
form
of
bee-hives,
some
of
them
as
large
and
spacious
as
one
of
the
"Huns'
graves,"
and
others
only
containing
room
enough
to
hold
three
or
four
men.
It
was
not
quite
dark;
the
northern
lights
shot
forth
red
and
blue
flames,
like
continuous
fireworks,
and
the
snow
glittered,
and
reflected
back
the
light,
so
that
the
night
here
was
one
long
twilight.
When
the
moon
was
brightest,
the
natives
came
in
crowds
to
see
the
sailors.
They
had
a
very
singular
appearance
in
their
rough,
hairy
dresses
of
fur,
and
riding
in
sledges
over
the
ice.
They
brought
with
them
furs
and
skins
in
great
abundance,
so
that
the
snow-houses
were
soon
provided
with
warm
carpets,
and
the
furs
also
served
for
the
sailors
to
wrap
themselves
in,
when
they
slept
under
the
roofs
of
snow,
while
outside
it
was
freezing
with
a
cold
far
more
severe
than
in
the
winter
with
us.
In
our
country
it
was
still
autumn,
though
late
in
the
season;
and
they
thought
of
that
in
their
distant
exile,
and
often
pictured
to
themselves
the
yellow
leaves
on
the
trees
at
home.
Their
watches
pointed
to
the
hours
of
evening,
and
time
to
go
to
sleep,
although
in
these
regions
it
was
now
always
night.
In
one
of
the
huts,
two
of
the
men
laid
themselves
down
to
rest.
The
younger
of
these
men
had
brought
with
him
from
home
his
best,
his
dearest
treasure—a
Bible,
which
his
grandmother
had
given
him
on
his
departure.
Every
night
the
sacred
volume
rested
under
his
head,
and
he
had
known
from
his
childhood
what
was
written
in
it.
Every
day
he
read
in
the
book,
and
while
stretched
on
his
cold
couch,
the
holy
words
he
had
learnt
would
come
into
his
mind:
"If
I
take
the
wings
of
the
morning,
and
fly
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea,
even
there
Thou
art
with
me,
and
Thy
right
hand
shall
uphold
me;"
and
under
the
influence
of
that
faith
which
these
holy
words
inspired,
sleep
came
upon
him,
and
dreams,
which
are
the
manifestations
of
God
to
the
spirit.
The
soul
lives
and
acts,
while
the
body
is
at
rest.
He
felt
this
life
in
him,
and
it
was
as
if
he
heard
the
sound
of
dear,
well-known
melodies,
as
if
the
breezes
of
summer
floated
around
him;
and
over
his
couch
shone
a
ray
of
brightness,
as
if
it
were
shining
through
the
covering
of
his
snow-roof.
He
lifted
his
head,
and
saw
that
the
bright
gleaming
was
not
the
reflection
of
the
glittering
snow,
but
the
dazzling
brightness
of
the
pinions
of
a
mighty
angel,
into
whose
beaming
face
he
was
gazing.
As
from
the
cup
of
a
lily,
the
angel
rose
from
amidst
the
leaves
of
the
Bible;
and,
stretching
out
his
arm,
the
walls
of
the
hut
sunk
down,
as
though
they
had
been
formed
of
a
light,
airy
veil
of
mist,
and
the
green
hills
and
meadows
of
home,
with
its
ruddy
woods,
lay
spread
around
him
in
the
quiet
sunshine
of
a
lovely
autumn
day.
The
nest
of
the
stork
was
empty,
but
ripe
fruit
still
hung
on
the
wild
apple-tree,
although
the
leaves
had
fallen.
The
red
hips
gleamed
on
the
hedges,
and
the
starling
which
hung
in
the
green
cage
outside
the
window
of
the
peasant's
hut,
which
was
his
home,
whistled
the
tune
which
he
had
taught
him.
His
grandmother
hung
green
birds'-food
around
the
cage,
as
he,
her
grandson,
had
been
accustomed
to
do.
The
daughter
of
the
village
blacksmith,
who
was
young
and
fair,
stood
at
the
well,
drawing
water.
She
nodded
to
the
grandmother,
and
the
old
woman
nodded
to
her,
and
pointed
to
a
letter
which
had
come
from
a
long
way
off.
That
very
morning
the
letter
had
arrived
from
the
cold
regions
of
the
north;
there,
where
the
absent
one
was
sweetly
sleeping
under
the
protecting
hand
of
God.
They
laughed
and
wept
over
the
letter;
and
he,
far
away,
amid
ice
and
snow,
under
the
shadow
of
the
angel's
wings,
wept
and
smiled
with
them
in
spirit;
for
he
saw
and
heard
it
all
in
his
dream.
From
the
letter
they
read
aloud
the
words
of
Holy
Writ:
"In
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea,
Thy
right
hand
shall
uphold
me."
And
as
the
angel
spread
his
wings
like
a
veil
over
the
sleeper,
there
was
the
sound
of
beautiful
music
and
a
hymn.
Then
the
vision
fled.
It
was
dark
again
in
the
snow-hut:
but
the
Bible
still
rested
beneath
his
head,
and
faith
and
hope
dwelt
in
his
heart.
God
was
with
him,
and
he
carried
home
in
his
heart,
even
"in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea."
