THE THISTLE'S EXPERIENCES
Belonging
to
the
lordly
manor-house
was
beautiful,
well-kept
garden,
with
rare
trees
and
flowers;
the
guests
of
the
proprietor
declared
their
admiration
of
it;
the
people
of
the
neighborhood,
from
town
and
country,
came
on
Sundays
and
holidays,
and
asked
permission
to
see
the
garden;
indeed,
whole
schools
used
to
pay
visits
to
it.
Outside
the
garden,
by
the
palings
at
the
road-side,
stood
a
great
mighty
Thistle,
which
spread
out
in
many
directions
from
the
root,
so
that
it
might
have
been
called
a
thistle
bush.
Nobody
looked
at
it,
except
the
old
Ass
which
drew
the
milk-maid's
cart.
This
Ass
used
to
stretch
out
his
neck
towards
the
Thistle,
and
say,
"You
are
beautiful;
I
should
like
to
eat
you!"
But
his
halter
was
not
long
enough
to
let
him
reach
it
and
eat
it.
There
was
great
company
at
the
manor-house—some
very
noble
people
from
the
capital;
young
pretty
girls,
and
among
them
a
young
lady
who
came
from
a
long
distance.
She
had
come
from
Scotland,
and
was
of
high
birth,
and
was
rich
in
land
and
in
gold—a
bride
worth
winning,
said
more
than
one
of
the
young
gentlemen;
and
their
lady
mothers
said
the
same
thing.
The
young
people
amused
themselves
on
the
lawn,
and
played
at
ball;
they
wandered
among
the
flowers,
and
each
of
the
young
girls
broke
off
a
flower,
and
fastened
it
in
a
young
gentleman's
buttonhole.
But
the
young
Scotch
lady
looked
round,
for
a
long
time,
in
an
undecided
way.
None
of
the
flowers
seemed
to
suit
her
taste.
Then
her
eye
glanced
across
the
paling—outside
stood
the
great
thistle
bush,
with
the
reddish-blue,
sturdy
flowers;
she
saw
them,
she
smiled,
and
asked
the
son
of
the
house
to
pluck
one
for
her.
"It
is
the
flower
of
Scotland,"
she
said.
"It
blooms
in
the
scutcheon
of
my
country.
Give
me
yonder
flower."
And
he
brought
the
fairest
blossom,
and
pricked
his
fingers
as
completely
as
if
it
had
grown
on
the
sharpest
rose
bush.
She
placed
the
thistle-flower
in
the
buttonhole
of
the
young
man,
and
he
felt
himself
highly
honored.
Each
of
the
other
young
gentlemen
would
willingly
have
given
his
own
beautiful
flower
to
have
worn
this
one,
presented
by
the
fair
hand
of
the
Scottish
maiden.
And
if
the
son
of
the
house
felt
himself
honored,
what
were
the
feelings
of
the
Thistle
bush?
It
seemed
to
him
as
if
dew
and
sunshine
were
streaming
through
him.
"I
am
something
more
than
I
knew
of,"
said
the
Thistle
to
itself.
"I
suppose
my
right
place
is
really
inside
the
palings,
and
not
outside.
One
is
often
strangely
placed
in
this
world;
but
now
I
have
at
least
managed
to
get
one
of
my
people
within
the
pale,
and
indeed
into
a
buttonhole!"
The
Thistle
told
this
event
to
every
blossom
that
unfolded
itself,
and
not
many
days
had
gone
by
before
the
Thistle
heard,
not
from
men,
not
from
the
twittering
of
the
birds,
but
from
the
air
itself,
which
stores
up
the
sounds,
and
carries
them
far
around—out
of
the
most
retired
walks
of
the
garden,
and
out
of
the
rooms
of
the
house,
in
which
doors
and
windows
stood
open,
that
the
young
gentleman
who
had
received
the
thistle-flower
from
the
hand
of
the
fair
Scottish
maiden
had
also
now
received
the
heart
and
hand
of
the
lady
in
question.
They
were
a
handsome
pair—it
was
a
good
match.
"That
match
I
made
up!"
said
the
Thistle;
and
he
thought
of
the
flower
he
had
given
for
the
buttonhole.
Every
flower
that
opened
heard
of
this
occurrence.
"I
shall
certainly
be
transplanted
into
the
garden,"
thought
the
Thistle,
"and
perhaps
put
into
a
pot,
which
crowds
one
in.
That
is
said
to
be
the
greatest
of
all
honors."
And
the
Thistle
pictured
this
to
himself
in
such
a
lively
manner,
that
at
last
he
said,
with
full
conviction,
"I
am
to
be
transplanted
into
a
pot."
Then
he
promised
every
little
thistle
flower
which
unfolded
itself
that
it
also
should
be
put
into
a
pot,
and
perhaps
into
a
buttonhole,
the
highest
honor
that
could
be
attained.
But
not
one
of
them
was
put
into
a
pot,
much
less
into
a
buttonhole.
They
drank
in
the
sunlight
and
the
air;
lived
on
the
sunlight
by
day,
and
on
the
dew
by
night;
bloomed—were
visited
by
bees
and
hornets,
who
looked
after
the
honey,
the
dowry
of
the
flower,
and
they
took
the
honey,
and
left
the
flower
where
it
was.
"The
thievish
rabble!"
said
the
Thistle.
"If
I
could
only
stab
every
one
of
them!
But
I
cannot."
The
flowers
hung
their
heads
and
faded;
but
after
a
time
new
ones
came.
"You
come
in
good
time,"
said
the
Thistle.
"I
am
expecting
every
moment
to
get
across
the
fence."
A
few
innocent
daisies,
and
a
long
thin
dandelion,
stood
and
listened
in
deep
admiration,
and
believed
everything
they
heard.
The
old
Ass
of
the
milk-cart
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
field-road,
and
glanced
across
at
the
blooming
thistle
bush;
but
his
halter
was
too
short,
and
he
could
not
reach
it.
And
the
Thistle
thought
so
long
of
the
thistle
of
Scotland,
to
whose
family
he
said
he
belonged,
that
he
fancied
at
last
that
he
had
come
from
Scotland,
and
that
his
parents
had
been
put
into
the
national
escutcheon.
That
was
a
great
thought;
but,
you
see,
a
great
thistle
has
a
right
to
a
great
thought.
"One
is
often
of
so
grand
a
family,
that
one
may
not
know
it,"
said
the
Nettle,
who
grew
close
by.
He
had
a
kind
of
idea
that
he
might
be
made
into
cambric
if
he
were
rightly
treated.
And
the
summer
went
by,
and
the
autumn
went
by.
The
leaves
fell
from
the
trees,
and
the
few
flowers
left
had
deeper
colors
and
less
scent.
The
gardener's
boy
sang
in
the
garden,
across
the
palings:
"Up
the
hill,
down
the
dale
we
wend,
That
is
life,
from
beginning
to
end."
The
young
fir
trees
in
the
forest
began
to
long
for
Christmas,
but
it
was
a
long
time
to
Christmas
yet.
"Here
I
am
standing
yet!"
said
the
Thistle.
"It
is
as
if
nobody
thought
of
me,
and
yet
I
managed
the
match.
They
were
betrothed,
and
they
have
had
their
wedding;
it
is
now
a
week
ago.
I
won't
take
a
single
step-because
I
can't."
A
few
more
weeks
went
by.
The
Thistle
stood
there
with
his
last
single
flower
large
and
full.
This
flower
had
shot
up
from
near
the
roots;
the
wind
blew
cold
over
it,
and
the
colors
vanished,
and
the
flower
grew
in
size,
and
looked
like
a
silvered
sunflower.
One
day
the
young
pair,
now
man
and
wife,
came
into
the
garden.
They
went
along
by
the
paling,
and
the
young
wife
looked
across
it.
"There's
the
great
thistle
still
growing,"
she
said.
"It
has
no
flowers
now."
"Oh,
yes,
the
ghost
of
the
last
one
is
there
still,"
said
he.
And
he
pointed
to
the
silvery
remains
of
the
flower,
which
looked
like
a
flower
themselves.
"It
is
pretty,
certainly,"
she
said.
"Such
an
one
must
be
carved
on
the
frame
of
our
picture."
And
the
young
man
had
to
climb
across
the
palings
again,
and
to
break
off
the
calyx
of
the
thistle.
It
pricked
his
fingers,
but
then
he
had
called
it
a
ghost.
And
this
thistle-calyx
came
into
the
garden,
and
into
the
house,
and
into
the
drawing-room.
There
stood
a
picture—"Young
Couple."
A
thistle-flower
was
painted
in
the
buttonhole
of
the
bridegroom.
They
spoke
about
this,
and
also
about
the
thistle-flower
they
brought,
the
last
thistle-flower,
now
gleaming
like
silver,
whose
picture
was
carved
on
the
frame.
And
the
breeze
carried
what
was
spoken
away,
far
away.
"What
one
can
experience!"
said
the
Thistle
Bush.
"My
first
born
was
put
into
a
buttonhole,
and
my
youngest
has
been
put
in
a
frame.
Where
shall
I
go?"
And
the
Ass
stood
by
the
road-side,
and
looked
across
at
the
Thistle.
"Come
to
me,
my
nibble
darling!"
said
he.
"I
can't
get
across
to
you."
But
the
Thistle
did
not
answer.
He
became
more
and
more
thoughtful—kept
on
thinking
and
thinking
till
near
Christmas,
and
then
a
flower
of
thought
came
forth.
"If
the
children
are
only
good,
the
parents
do
not
mind
standing
outside
the
garden
pale."
"That's
an
honorable
thought,"
said
the
Sunbeam.
"You
shall
also
have
a
good
place."
"In
a
pot
or
in
a
frame?"
asked
the
Thistle.
"In
a
story,"
replied
the
Sunbeam.
