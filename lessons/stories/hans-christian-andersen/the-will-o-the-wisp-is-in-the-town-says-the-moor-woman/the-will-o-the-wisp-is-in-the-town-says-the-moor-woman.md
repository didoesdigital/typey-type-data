THE WILL-O-THE WISP IS IN THE TOWN, SAYS THE MOOR WOMAN
There
was
a
man
who
once
knew
many
stories,
but
they
had
slipped
away
from
him—so
he
said.
The
Story
that
used
to
visit
him
of
its
own
accord
no
longer
came
and
knocked
at
his
door.
And
why
did
it
come
no
longer?
It
is
true
enough
that
for
days
and
years
the
man
had
not
thought
of
it,
had
not
expected
it
to
come
and
knock;
and
if
he
had
expected
it,
it
would
certainly
not
have
come;
for
without
there
was
war,
and
within
was
the
care
and
sorrow
that
war
brings
with
it.
The
stork
and
the
swallows
came
back
from
their
long
journey,
for
they
thought
of
no
danger;
and,
behold,
when
they
arrived,
the
nest
was
burnt,
the
habitations
of
men
were
burnt,
the
hedges
were
all
in
disorder,
and
everything
seemed
gone,
and
the
enemy's
horses
were
stamping
in
the
old
graves.
Those
were
hard,
gloomy
times,
but
they
came
to
an
end.
And
now
they
were
past
and
gone—so
people
said;
yet
no
Story
came
and
knocked
at
the
door,
or
gave
any
tidings
of
its
presence.
"I
suppose
it
must
be
dead,
or
gone
away
with
many
other
things,"
said
the
man.
But
the
story
never
dies.
And
more
than
a
whole
year
went
by,
and
he
longed—oh,
so
very
much!—for
the
Story.
"I
wonder
if
the
Story
will
ever
come
back
again
and
knock?"
And
he
remembered
it
so
well
in
all
the
various
forms
in
which
it
had
come
to
him,
sometimes
young
and
charming,
like
spring
itself,
sometimes
as
a
beautiful
maiden,
with
a
wreath
of
thyme
in
her
hair,
and
a
beechen
branch
in
her
hand,
and
with
eyes
that
gleamed
like
deep
woodland
lakes
in
the
bright
sunshine.
Sometimes
it
had
come
to
him
in
the
guise
of
a
peddler,
and
had
opened
its
box
and
let
silver
ribbon
come
fluttering
out,
with
verses
and
inscriptions
of
old
remembrances.
But
it
was
most
charming
of
all
when
it
came
as
an
old
grandmother,
with
silvery
hair,
and
such
large,
sensible
eyes.
She
knew
so
well
how
to
tell
about
the
oldest
times,
long
before
the
princesses
spun
with
the
golden
spindles,
and
the
dragons
lay
outside
the
castles,
guarding
them.
She
told
with
such
an
air
of
truth,
that
black
spots
danced
before
the
eyes
of
all
who
heard
her,
and
the
floor
became
black
with
human
blood;
terrible
to
see
and
to
hear,
and
yet
so
entertaining,
because
such
a
long
time
had
passed
since
it
all
happened.
"Will
it
ever
knock
at
my
door
again?"
said
the
man,
and
he
gazed
at
the
door,
so
that
black
spots
came
before
his
eyes
and
upon
the
floor;
he
did
not
know
if
it
was
blood,
or
mourning
crape
from
the
dark
heavy
days.
And
as
he
sat
thus,
the
thought
came
upon
him
whether
the
Story
might
not
have
hidden
itself,
like
the
princess
in
the
old
tale.
And
he
would
now
go
in
search
of
it;
if
he
found
it,
it
would
beam
in
new
splendor,
lovelier
than
ever.
"Who
knows?
Perhaps
it
has
hidden
itself
in
the
straw
that
balances
on
the
margin
of
the
well.
Carefully,
carefully!
Perhaps
it
lies
hidden
in
a
certain
flower—that
flower
in
one
of
the
great
books
on
the
book-shelf."
And
the
man
went
and
opened
one
of
the
newest
books,
to
gain
information
on
this
point;
but
there
was
no
flower
to
be
found.
There
he
read
about
Holger
Danske;
and
the
man
read
that
the
tale
had
been
invented
and
put
together
by
a
monk
in
France,
that
it
was
a
romance,
"translated
into
Danish
and
printed
in
that
language;"
that
Holger
Danske
had
never
really
lived,
and
consequently
could
never
come
again,
as
we
have
sung,
and
have
been
so
glad
to
believe.
And
William
Tell
was
treated
just
like
Holger
Danske.
These
were
all
only
myths—nothing
on
which
we
could
depend;
and
yet
it
is
all
written
in
a
very
learned
book.
"Well,
I
shall
believe
what
I
believe!"
said
the
man.
"There
grows
no
plantain
where
no
foot
has
trod."
And
he
closed
the
book
and
put
it
back
in
its
place,
and
went
to
the
fresh
flowers
at
the
window.
Perhaps
the
Story
might
have
hidden
itself
in
the
red
tulips,
with
the
golden
yellow
edges,
or
in
the
fresh
rose,
or
in
the
beaming
camellia.
The
sunshine
lay
among
the
flowers,
but
no
Story.
The
flowers
which
had
been
here
in
the
dark
troublous
time
had
been
much
more
beautiful;
but
they
had
been
cut
off,
one
after
another,
to
be
woven
into
wreaths
and
placed
in
coffins,
and
the
flag
had
waved
over
them!
Perhaps
the
Story
had
been
buried
with
the
flowers;
but
then
the
flowers
would
have
known
of
it,
and
the
coffin
would
have
heard
it,
and
every
little
blade
of
grass
that
shot
forth
would
have
told
of
it.
The
Story
never
dies.
Perhaps
it
has
been
here
once,
and
has
knocked;
but
who
had
eyes
or
ears
for
it
in
those
times?
People
looked
darkly,
gloomily,
and
almost
angrily
at
the
sunshine
of
spring,
at
the
twittering
birds,
and
all
the
cheerful
green;
the
tongue
could
not
even
bear
the
old
merry,
popular
songs,
and
they
were
laid
in
the
coffin
with
so
much
that
our
heart
held
dear.
The
Story
may
have
knocked
without
obtaining
a
hearing;
there
was
none
to
bid
it
welcome,
and
so
it
may
have
gone
away.
"I
will
go
forth
and
seek
it.
Out
in
the
country!
out
in
the
wood!
and
on
the
open
sea
beach!"
Out
in
the
country
lies
an
old
manor
house,
with
red
walls,
pointed
gables,
and
a
red
flag
that
floats
on
the
tower.
The
nightingale
sings
among
the
finely-fringed
beech-leaves,
looking
at
the
blooming
apple
trees
of
the
garden,
and
thinking
that
they
bear
roses.
Here
the
bees
are
mightily
busy
in
the
summer-time,
and
hover
round
their
queen
with
their
humming
song.
The
autumn
has
much
to
tell
of
the
wild
chase,
of
the
leaves
of
the
trees,
and
of
the
races
of
men
that
are
passing
away
together.
The
wild
swans
sing
at
Christmas-time
on
the
open
water,
while
in
the
old
hall
the
guests
by
the
fireside
gladly
listen
to
songs
and
to
old
legends.
Down
into
the
old
part
of
the
garden,
where
the
great
avenue
of
wild
chestnut
trees
lures
the
wanderer
to
tread
its
shades,
went
the
man
who
was
in
search
of
the
Story;
for
here
the
wind
had
once
murmured
something
to
him
of
"Waldemar
Daa
and
his
Daughters."
The
Dryad
in
the
tree,
who
was
the
Story-mother
herself,
had
here
told
him
the
"Dream
of
the
Old
Oak
Tree."
Here,
in
the
time
of
the
ancestral
mother,
had
stood
clipped
hedges,
but
now
only
ferns
and
stinging
nettles
grew
there,
hiding
the
scattered
fragments
of
old
sculptured
figures;
the
moss
is
growing
in
their
eyes,
but
they
can
see
as
well
as
ever,
which
was
more
than
the
man
could
do
who
was
in
search
of
the
Story,
for
he
could
not
find
that.
Where
could
it
be?
The
crows
flew
past
him
by
hundreds
across
the
old
trees,
and
screamed,
"Krah!
da!—Krah!
da!"
And
he
went
out
of
the
garden
and
over
the
grass-plot
of
the
yard,
into
the
alder
grove;
there
stood
a
little
six-sided
house,
with
a
poultry-yard
and
a
duck-yard.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
sat
the
old
woman
who
had
the
management
of
the
whole,
and
who
knew
accurately
about
every
egg
that
was
laid,
and
about
every
chicken
that
could
creep
out
of
an
egg.
But
she
was
not
the
Story
of
which
the
man
was
in
search;
that
she
could
attest
with
a
Christian
certificate
of
baptism
and
of
vaccination
that
lay
in
her
drawer.
Without,
not
far
from
the
house,
is
a
hill
covered
with
red-thorn
and
broom.
Here
lies
an
old
grave-stone,
which
was
brought
here
many
years
ago
from
the
churchyard
of
the
provincial
town,
a
remembrance
of
one
of
the
most
honored
councillors
of
the
place;
his
wife
and
his
five
daughters,
all
with
folded
hands
and
stiff
ruffs,
stand
round
him.
One
could
look
at
them
so
long,
that
it
had
an
effect
upon
the
thoughts,
and
these
reacted
upon
the
stones,
as
if
they
were
telling
of
old
times;
at
least
it
had
been
so
with
the
man
who
was
in
search
of
the
Story.
As
he
came
nearer,
he
noticed
a
living
butterfly
sitting
on
the
forehead
of
the
sculptured
councillor.
The
butterfly
flapped
its
wings,
and
flew
a
little
bit
farther,
and
then
returned
fatigued
to
sit
upon
the
grave-stone,
as
if
to
point
out
what
grew
there.
Four-leaved
shamrocks
grew
there;
there
were
seven
specimens
close
to
each
other.
When
fortune
comes,
it
comes
in
a
heap.
He
plucked
the
shamrocks
and
put
them
in
his
pocket.
"Fortune
is
as
good
as
red
gold,
but
a
new
charming
story
would
be
better
still,"
thought
the
man;
but
he
could
not
find
it
here.
And
the
sun
went
down,
round
and
large;
the
meadow
was
covered
with
vapor.
The
moor-woman
was
at
her
brewing.
It
was
evening.
He
stood
alone
in
his
room,
and
looked
out
upon
the
sea,
over
the
meadow,
over
moor
and
coast.
The
moon
shone
bright,
a
mist
was
over
the
meadow,
making
it
look
like
a
great
lake;
and,
indeed,
it
was
once
so,
as
the
legend
tells—and
in
the
moonlight
the
eye
realizes
these
myths.
Then
the
man
thought
of
what
he
had
been
reading
in
the
town,
that
William
Tell
and
Holger
Danske
never
really
lived,
but
yet
live
in
popular
story,
like
the
lake
yonder,
a
living
evidence
for
such
myths.
Yes,
Holger
Danske
will
return
again!
As
he
stood
thus
and
thought,
something
beat
quite
strongly
against
the
window.
Was
it
a
bird,
a
bat
or
an
owl?
Those
are
not
let
in,
even
when
they
knock.
The
window
flew
open
of
itself,
and
an
old
woman
looked
in
at
the
man.
"What's
your
pleasure?"
said
he.
"Who
are
you?
You're
looking
in
at
the
first
floor
window.
Are
you
standing
on
a
ladder?"
"You
have
a
four-leaved
shamrock
in
your
pocket,"
she
replied.
"Indeed,
you
have
seven,
and
one
of
them
is
a
six-leaved
one."
"Who
are
you?"
asked
the
man
again.
"The
Moor-woman,"
she
replied.
"The
Moor-woman
who
brews.
I
was
at
it.
The
bung
was
in
the
cask,
but
one
of
the
little
moor-imps
pulled
it
out
in
his
mischief,
and
flung
it
up
into
the
yard,
where
it
beat
against
the
window;
and
now
the
beer's
running
out
of
the
cask,
and
that
won't
do
good
to
anybody."
"Pray
tell
me
some
more!"
said
the
man.
"Yes,
wait
a
little,"
answered
the
Moor-woman.
"I've
something
else
to
do
just
now."
And
she
was
gone.
The
man
was
going
to
shut
the
window,
when
the
woman
already
stood
before
him
again.
"Now
it's
done,"
she
said;
"but
I
shall
have
half
the
beer
to
brew
over
again
to-morrow,
if
the
weather
is
suitable.
Well,
what
have
you
to
ask
me?
I've
come
back,
for
I
always
keep
my
word,
and
you
have
seven
four-leaved
shamrocks
in
your
pocket,
and
one
of
them
is
a
six-leaved
one.
That
inspires
respect,
for
that's
an
order
that
grows
beside
the
sandy
way;
but
that
every
one
does
not
find.
What
have
you
to
ask
me?
Don't
stand
there
like
a
ridiculous
oaf,
for
I
must
go
back
again
directly
to
my
bung
and
my
cask."
And
the
man
asked
about
the
Story,
and
inquired
if
the
Moor-woman
had
met
it
in
her
journeyings.
"By
the
big
brewing-vat!"
exclaimed
the
woman,
"haven't
you
got
stories
enough?
I
really
believe
that
most
people
have
enough
of
them.
Here
are
other
things
to
take
notice
of,
other
things
to
examine.
Even
the
children
have
gone
beyond
that.
Give
the
little
boy
a
cigar,
and
the
little
girl
a
new
crinoline;
they
like
that
much
better.
To
listen
to
stories!
No,
indeed,
there
are
more
important
things
to
be
done
here,
and
other
things
to
notice!"
"What
do
you
mean
by
that?"
asked
the
man,
"and
what
do
you
know
of
the
world?
You
don't
see
anything
but
frogs
and
Will-o'-the-Wisps!"
"Yes,
beware
of
the
Will-o'-the-Wisps,"
said
the
Moor-woman,
"for
they're
out—they're
let
loose—that's
what
we
must
talk
about!
Come
to
me
in
the
moor,
where
my
presence
is
necessary,
and
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it;
but
you
must
make
haste,
and
come
while
your
seven
four-leaved
shamrocks,
for
which
one
has
six
leaves,
are
still
fresh,
and
the
moon
stands
high!"
And
the
Moor-woman
was
gone.
It
struck
twelve
in
the
town,
and
before
the
last
stroke
had
died
away,
the
man
was
out
in
the
yard,
out
in
the
garden,
and
stood
in
the
meadow.
The
mist
had
vanished,
and
the
Moor-woman
stopped
her
brewing.
"You've
been
a
long
time
coming!"
said
the
Moor-woman.
"Witches
get
forward
faster
than
men,
and
I'm
glad
that
I
belong
to
the
witch
folk!"
"What
have
you
to
say
to
me
now?"
asked
the
man.
"Is
it
anything
about
the
Story?"
"Can
you
never
get
beyond
asking
about
that?"
retorted
the
woman.
"Can
you
tell
me
anything
about
the
poetry
of
the
future?"
resumed
the
man.
"Don't
get
on
your
stilts,"
said
the
crone,
"and
I'll
answer
you.
You
think
of
nothing
but
poetry,
and
only
ask
about
that
Story,
as
if
she
were
the
lady
of
the
whole
troop.
She's
the
oldest
of
us
all,
but
she
takes
precedence
of
the
youngest.
I
know
her
well.
I've
been
young,
too,
and
she's
no
chicken
now.
I
was
once
quite
a
pretty
elf-maiden,
and
have
danced
in
my
time
with
the
others
in
the
moonlight,
and
have
heard
the
nightingale,
and
have
gone
into
the
forest
and
met
the
Story-maiden,
who
was
always
to
be
found
out
there,
running
about.
Sometimes
she
took
up
her
night's
lodging
in
a
half-blown
tulip,
or
in
a
field
flower;
sometimes
she
would
slip
into
the
church,
and
wrap
herself
in
the
mourning
crape
that
hung
down
from
the
candles
on
the
altar."
"You
are
capitally
well-informed,"
said
the
man.
"I
ought
at
least
to
know
as
much
as
you,"
answered
the
Moor-woman.
"Stories
and
poetry—yes,
they're
like
two
yards
of
the
same
piece
of
stuff;
they
can
go
and
lie
down
where
they
like,
and
one
can
brew
all
their
prattle,
and
have
it
all
the
better
and
cheaper.
You
shall
have
it
from
me
for
nothing.
I
have
a
whole
cupboard-full
of
poetry
in
bottles.
It
makes
essences;
and
that's
the
best
of
it—bitter
and
sweet
herbs.
I
have
everything
that
people
want
of
poetry,
in
bottles,
so
that
I
can
put
a
little
on
my
handkerchief,
on
holidays,
to
smell."
"Why,
these
are
wonderful
things
that
you're
telling!"
said
the
man.
"You
have
poetry
in
bottles?"
"More
than
you
can
require,"
said
the
woman.
"I
suppose
you
know
the
history
of
'the
Girl
who
Trod
on
the
Loaf,
so
that
she
might
not
soil
her
shoes'?
That
has
been
written,
and
printed
too."
"I
told
that
story
myself,"
said
the
man.
"Yes,
then
you
must
know
it;
and
you
must
know
also
that
the
girl
sank
into
the
earth
directly,
to
the
Moor-woman,
just
as
Old
Bogey's
grandmother
was
paying
her
morning
visit
to
inspect
the
brewery.
She
saw
the
girl
gliding
down,
and
asked
to
have
her
as
a
remembrance
of
her
visit,
and
got
her
too;
while
I
received
a
present
that's
of
no
use
to
me—a
travelling
druggist's
shop—a
whole
cupboard-full
of
poetry
in
bottles.
Grandmother
told
me
where
the
cupboard
was
to
be
placed,
and
there
it's
standing
still.
Just
look!
You've
your
seven
four-leaved
shamrocks
in
your
pocket,
one
of
which
is
a
six-leaved
one,
and
so
you
will
be
able
to
see
it."
And
really
in
the
midst
of
the
moor
lay
something
like
a
great
knotted
block
of
alder,
and
that
was
the
old
grandmother's
cupboard.
The
Moor-woman
said
that
this
was
always
open
to
her
and
to
every
one
in
the
land,
if
they
only
knew
where
the
cupboard
stood.
It
could
be
opened
either
at
the
front
or
at
the
back,
and
at
every
side
and
corner—a
perfect
work
of
art,
and
yet
only
an
old
alder
stump
in
appearance.
The
poets
of
all
lands,
and
especially
those
of
our
own
country,
had
been
arranged
here;
the
spirit
of
them
had
been
extracted,
refined,
criticised
and
renovated,
and
then
stored
up
in
bottles.
With
what
may
be
called
great
aptitude,
if
it
was
not
genius
the
grandmother
had
taken
as
it
were
the
flavor
of
this
and
of
that
poet,
and
had
added
a
little
devilry,
and
then
corked
up
the
bottles
for
use
during
all
future
times.
"Pray
let
me
see,"
said
the
man.
"Yes,
but
there
are
more
important
things
to
hear,"
replied
the
Moor-woman.
"But
now
we
are
at
the
cupboard!"
said
the
man.
And
he
looked
in.
"Here
are
bottles
of
all
sizes.
What
is
in
this
one?
and
what
in
that
one
yonder?"
"Here
is
what
they
call
may-balm,"
replied
the
woman.
"I
have
not
tried
it
myself.
But
I
have
not
yet
told
you
the
'more
important'
thing
you
were
to
hear.
THE
WILL-O'-THE-WISP'S
IN
THE
TOWN!
That's
of
much
more
consequence
than
poetry
and
stories.
I
ought,
indeed,
to
hold
my
tongue;
but
there
must
be
a
necessity—a
fate—a
something
that
sticks
in
my
throat,
and
that
wants
to
come
out.
Take
care,
you
mortals!"
"I
don't
understand
a
word
of
all
this!"
cried
the
man.
"Be
kind
enough
to
seat
yourself
on
that
cupboard,"
she
retorted,
"but
take
care
you
don't
fall
through
and
break
the
bottles—you
know
what's
inside
of
them.
I
must
tell
of
the
great
event.
It
occurred
no
longer
ago
than
the
day
before
yesterday.
It
did
not
happen
earlier.
It
has
now
three
hundred
and
sixty-three
days
to
run
about.
I
suppose
you
know
how
many
days
there
are
in
a
year?"
And
this
is
what
the
Moor-woman
told:
"There
was
a
great
commotion
yesterday
out
here
in
the
marsh!
There
was
a
christening
feast!
A
little
Will-o'-the-Wisp
was
born
here—in
fact,
twelve
of
them
were
born
all
together;
and
they
have
permission,
if
they
choose
to
use
it,
to
go
abroad
among
men,
and
to
move
about
and
command
among
them,
just
as
if
they
were
born
mortals.
That
was
a
great
event
in
the
marsh,
and
accordingly
all
the
Will-o'-the-Wisps,
male
and
female,
went
dancing
like
little
lights
across
the
moor.
There
are
some
of
them
of
the
dog
species,
but
those
are
not
worth
mentioning.
I
sat
there
on
the
cupboard,
and
had
all
the
twelve
little
new-born
Will-o'-the-Wisps
upon
my
lap.
They
shone
like
glow-worms;
they
already
began
to
hop,
and
increased
in
size
every
moment,
so
that
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed,
each
of
them
looked
just
as
large
as
his
father
or
his
uncle.
Now,
it's
an
old-established
regulation
and
favor,
that
when
the
moon
stands
just
as
it
did
yesterday,
and
the
wind
blows
just
as
it
blew
then,
it
is
allowed
and
accorded
to
all
Will-o'-the-Wisps—that
is,
to
all
those
who
are
born
at
that
minute
of
time—to
become
mortals,
and
individually
to
exert
their
power
for
the
space
of
one
year.
"The
Will-o'-the-Wisp
may
run
about
in
the
country
and
through
the
world,
if
it
is
not
afraid
of
falling
into
the
sea,
or
of
being
blown
out
by
a
heavy
storm.
It
can
enter
into
a
person
and
speak
for
him,
and
make
all
the
movements
it
pleases.
The
Will-o'-the-Wisp
may
take
whatever
form
he
likes,
of
man
or
woman,
and
can
act
in
their
spirit
and
in
their
disguise
in
such
a
way
that
he
can
effect
whatever
he
wishes
to
do.
But
he
must
manage,
in
the
course
of
the
year,
to
lead
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
people
into
a
bad
way,
and
in
a
grand
style,
too.
To
lead
them
away
from
the
right
and
the
truth;
and
then
he
reaches
the
highest
point.
Such
a
Will-o'-the-Wisp
can
attain
to
the
honor
of
being
a
runner
before
the
devil's
state
coach;
and
then
he'll
wear
clothes
of
fiery
yellow,
and
breathe
forth
flames
out
of
his
throat.
That's
enough
to
make
a
simple
Will-o'-the-Wisp
smack
his
lips.
But
there's
some
danger
in
this,
and
a
great
deal
of
work
for
a
Will-o'-the-Wisp
who
aspires
to
play
so
distinguished
a
part.
If
the
eyes
of
the
man
are
opened
to
what
he
is,
and
if
the
man
can
then
blow
him
away,
it's
all
over
with
him,
and
he
must
come
back
into
the
marsh;
or
if,
before
the
year
is
up,
the
Will-o'-the-Wisp
is
seized
with
a
longing
to
see
his
family,
and
so
returns
to
it
and
gives
the
matter
up,
it
is
over
with
him
likewise,
and
he
can
no
longer
burn
clear,
and
soon
becomes
extinguished,
and
cannot
be
lit
up
again;
and
when
the
year
has
elapsed,
and
he
has
not
led
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
people
away
from
the
truth
and
from
all
that
is
grand
and
noble,
he
is
condemned
to
be
imprisoned
in
decayed
wood,
and
to
lie
glimmering
there,
without
being
able
to
move;
and
that's
the
most
terrible
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
on
a
lively
Will-o'-the-Wisp.
"Now,
all
this
I
know,
and
all
this
I
told
to
the
twelve
little
Will-o'-the-Wisps
whom
I
had
on
my
lap,
and
who
seemed
quite
crazy
with
joy.
"I
told
them
that
the
safest
and
most
convenient
course
was
to
give
up
the
honor,
and
do
nothing
at
all;
but
the
little
flames
would
not
agree
to
this,
and
already
fancied
themselves
clad
in
fiery
yellow
clothes,
breathing
flames
from
their
throats.
"'Stay
with
us,'
said
some
of
the
older
ones.
"'Carry
on
your
sport
with
mortals,'
said
the
others.
"'The
mortals
are
drying
up
our
meadows;
they've
taken
to
draining.
What
will
our
successors
do?'
"'We
want
to
flame;
we
will
flame—flame!'
cried
the
new-born
Will-o'the-Wisps.
"And
thus
the
affair
was
settled.
"And
now
a
ball
was
given,
a
minute
long;
it
could
not
well
be
shorter.
The
little
elf-maidens
whirled
round
three
times
with
the
rest,
that
they
might
not
appear
proud,
but
they
preferred
dancing
with
one
another.
"And
now
the
sponsors'
gifts
were
presented,
and
presents
were
thrown
them.
These
presents
flew
like
pebbles
across
the
sea-water.
Each
of
the
elf-maidens
gave
a
little
piece
of
her
veil.
"'Take
that,'
they
said,
'and
then
you'll
know
the
higher
dance,
the
most
difficult
turns
and
twists—that
is
to
say,
if
you
should
find
them
necessary.
You'll
know
the
proper
deportment,
and
then
you
can
show
yourself
in
the
very
pick
of
society.'
"The
night
raven
taught
each
of
the
young
Will-o'-the-Wisps
to
say,
'Goo-goo-good,'
and
to
say
it
in
the
right
place;
and
that's
a
great
gift
which
brings
its
own
reward.
"The
owl
and
the
stork—but
they
said
it
was
not
worth
mentioning,
and
so
we
won't
mention
it.
"King
Waldemar's
wild
chase
was
just
then
rushing
over
the
moor,
and
when
the
great
lords
heard
of
the
festivities
that
were
going
on,
they
sent
a
couple
of
handsome
dogs,
which
hunt
on
the
spoor
of
the
wind,
as
a
present;
and
these
might
carry
two
or
three
of
the
Will-o'-the-Wisps.
A
couple
of
old
Alpas,
spirits
who
occupy
themselves
with
Alp-pressing,
were
also
at
the
feast;
and
from
these
the
young
Will-o'-the-Wisps
learned
the
art
of
slipping
through
every
key-hole,
as
if
the
door
stood
open
before
them.
These
Alpas
offered
to
carry
the
youngsters
to
the
town,
with
which
they
were
well
acquainted.
They
usually
rode
through
the
atmosphere
on
their
own
back
hair,
which
is
fastened
into
a
knot,
for
they
love
a
hard
seat;
but
now
they
sat
sideways
on
the
wild
hunting
dogs,
took
the
young
Will-o'-the-Wisps
in
their
laps,
who
wanted
to
go
into
the
town
to
mislead
and
entice
mortals,
and,
whisk!
away
they
were.
Now,
this
is
what
happened
last
night.
To-day
the
Will-o'-the-Wisps
are
in
the
town,
and
have
taken
the
matter
in
hand—but
where
and
how?
Ah,
can
you
tell
me
that?
Still,
I've
a
lightning
conductor
in
my
great
toe,
and
that
will
always
tell
me
something."
"Why,
this
is
a
complete
story,"
exclaimed
the
man.
"Yes,
but
it
is
only
the
beginning,"
replied
the
woman.
"Can
you
tell
me
how
the
Will-o'-the-Wisps
deport
themselves,
and
how
they
behave?
and
in
what
shapes
they
have
aforetime
appeared
and
led
people
into
crooked
paths?"
"I
believe,"
replied
the
man,
"that
one
could
tell
quite
a
romance
about
the
Will-o'-the-Wisps,
in
twelve
parts;
or,
better
still,
one
might
make
quite
a
popular
play
of
them."
"You
might
write
that,"
said
the
woman,
"but
it's
best
let
alone."
"Yes,
that's
better
and
more
agreeable,"
the
man
replied,
"for
then
we
shall
escape
from
the
newspapers,
and
not
be
tied
up
by
them,
which
is
just
as
uncomfortable
as
for
a
Will-o'-the-Wisp
to
lie
in
decaying
wood,
to
have
to
gleam,
and
not
to
be
able
to
stir."
"I
don't
care
about
it
either
way,"
cried
the
woman.
"Let
the
rest
write,
those
who
can,
and
those
who
cannot
likewise.
I'll
grant
you
an
old
bung
from
my
cask
that
will
open
the
cupboard
where
poetry's
kept
in
bottles,
and
you
may
take
from
that
whatever
may
be
wanting.
But
you,
my
good
man,
seem
to
have
blotted
your
hands
sufficiently
with
ink,
and
to
have
come
to
that
age
of
satiety
that
you
need
not
be
running
about
every
year
for
stories,
especially
as
there
are
much
more
important
things
to
be
done.
You
must
have
understood
what
is
going
on?"
"The
Will-o'-the-Wisp
is
in
town,"
said
the
man.
"I've
heard
it,
and
I
have
understood
it.
But
what
do
you
think
I
ought
to
do?
I
should
be
thrashed
if
I
were
to
go
to
the
people
and
say,
'Look,
yonder
goes
a
Will-o'-the-Wisp
in
his
best
clothes!'
"They
also
go
in
undress,"
replied
the
woman.
"The
Will-o'-the-Wisp
can
assume
all
kinds
of
forms,
and
appear
in
every
place.
He
goes
into
the
church,
but
not
for
the
sake
of
the
service;
and
perhaps
he
may
enter
into
one
or
other
of
the
priests.
He
speaks
in
the
Parliament,
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
country,
but
only
for
himself.
He's
an
artist
with
the
color-pot
as
well
as
in
the
theatre;
but
when
he
gets
all
the
power
into
his
own
hands,
then
the
pot's
empty!
I
chatter
and
chatter,
but
it
must
come
out,
what's
sticking
in
my
throat,
to
the
disadvantage
of
my
own
family.
But
I
must
now
be
the
woman
that
will
save
a
good
many
people.
It
is
not
done
with
my
good
will,
or
for
the
sake
of
a
medal.
I
do
the
most
insane
things
I
possibly
can,
and
then
I
tell
a
poet
about
it,
and
thus
the
whole
town
gets
to
know
of
it
directly."
"The
town
will
not
take
that
to
heart,"
observed
the
man;
"that
will
not
disturb
a
single
person;
for
they
will
all
think
I'm
only
telling
them
a
story
if
I
say,
'The
Will-o'-the-Wisp
is
in
the
town,
says
the
Moor-woman.
Take
care
of
yourselves!'"
