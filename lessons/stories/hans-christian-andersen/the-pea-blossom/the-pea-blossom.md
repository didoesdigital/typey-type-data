THE PEA BLOSSOM
There
were
once
five
peas
in
one
shell,
they
were
green,
the
shell
was
green,
and
so
they
believed
that
the
whole
world
must
be
green
also,
which
was
a
very
natural
conclusion.
The
shell
grew,
and
the
peas
grew,
they
accommodated
themselves
to
their
position,
and
sat
all
in
a
row.
The
sun
shone
without
and
warmed
the
shell,
and
the
rain
made
it
clear
and
transparent;
it
was
mild
and
agreeable
in
broad
daylight,
and
dark
at
night,
as
it
generally
is;
and
the
peas
as
they
sat
there
grew
bigger
and
bigger,
and
more
thoughtful
as
they
mused,
for
they
felt
there
must
be
something
else
for
them
to
do.
"Are
we
to
sit
here
forever?"
asked
one;
"shall
we
not
become
hard
by
sitting
so
long?
It
seems
to
me
there
must
be
something
outside,
and
I
feel
sure
of
it."
And
as
weeks
passed
by,
the
peas
became
yellow,
and
the
shell
became
yellow.
"All
the
world
is
turning
yellow,
I
suppose,"
said
they,—and
perhaps
they
were
right.
Suddenly
they
felt
a
pull
at
the
shell;
it
was
torn
off,
and
held
in
human
hands,
then
slipped
into
the
pocket
of
a
jacket
in
company
with
other
full
pods.
"Now
we
shall
soon
be
opened,"
said
one,—just
what
they
all
wanted.
"I
should
like
to
know
which
of
us
will
travel
furthest,"
said
the
smallest
of
the
five;
"we
shall
soon
see
now."
"What
is
to
happen
will
happen,"
said
the
largest
pea.
"Crack"
went
the
shell
as
it
burst,
and
the
five
peas
rolled
out
into
the
bright
sunshine.
There
they
lay
in
a
child's
hand.
A
little
boy
was
holding
them
tightly,
and
said
they
were
fine
peas
for
his
pea-shooter.
And
immediately
he
put
one
in
and
shot
it
out.
"Now
I
am
flying
out
into
the
wide
world,"
said
he;
"catch
me
if
you
can;"
and
he
was
gone
in
a
moment.
"I,"
said
the
second,
"intend
to
fly
straight
to
the
sun,
that
is
a
shell
that
lets
itself
be
seen,
and
it
will
suit
me
exactly;"
and
away
he
went.
"We
will
go
to
sleep
wherever
we
find
ourselves,"
said
the
two
next,
"we
shall
still
be
rolling
onwards;"
and
they
did
certainly
fall
on
the
floor,
and
roll
about
before
they
got
into
the
pea-shooter;
but
they
were
put
in
for
all
that.
"We
shall
go
farther
than
the
others,"
said
they.
"What
is
to
happen
will
happen,"
exclaimed
the
last,
as
he
was
shot
out
of
the
pea-shooter;
and
as
he
spoke
he
flew
up
against
an
old
board
under
a
garret-window,
and
fell
into
a
little
crevice,
which
was
almost
filled
up
with
moss
and
soft
earth.
The
moss
closed
itself
round
him,
and
there
he
lay,
a
captive
indeed,
but
not
unnoticed
by
God.
"What
is
to
happen
will
happen,"
said
he
to
himself.
Within
the
little
garret
lived
a
poor
woman,
who
went
out
to
clean
stoves,
chop
wood
into
small
pieces
and
perform
such-like
hard
work,
for
she
was
strong
and
industrious.
Yet
she
remained
always
poor,
and
at
home
in
the
garret
lay
her
only
daughter,
not
quite
grown
up,
and
very
delicate
and
weak.
For
a
whole
year
she
had
kept
her
bed,
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
neither
live
nor
die.
"She
is
going
to
her
little
sister,"
said
the
woman;
"I
had
but
the
two
children,
and
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
support
both
of
them;
but
the
good
God
helped
me
in
my
work,
and
took
one
of
them
to
Himself
and
provided
for
her.
Now
I
would
gladly
keep
the
other
that
was
left
to
me,
but
I
suppose
they
are
not
to
be
separated,
and
my
sick
girl
will
very
soon
go
to
her
sister
above."
But
the
sick
girl
still
remained
where
she
was,
quietly
and
patiently
she
lay
all
the
day
long,
while
her
mother
was
away
from
home
at
her
work.
Spring
came,
and
one
morning
early
the
sun
shone
brightly
through
the
little
window,
and
threw
its
rays
over
the
floor
of
the
room.
Just
as
the
mother
was
going
to
her
work,
the
sick
girl
fixed
her
gaze
on
the
lowest
pane
of
the
window—"Mother,"
she
exclaimed,
"what
can
that
little
green
thing
be
that
peeps
in
at
the
window?
It
is
moving
in
the
wind."
The
mother
stepped
to
the
window
and
half
opened
it.
"Oh!"
she
said,
"there
is
actually
a
little
pea
which
has
taken
root
and
is
putting
out
its
green
leaves.
How
could
it
have
got
into
this
crack?
Well
now,
here
is
a
little
garden
for
you
to
amuse
yourself
with."
So
the
bed
of
the
sick
girl
was
drawn
nearer
to
the
window,
that
she
might
see
the
budding
plant;
and
the
mother
went
out
to
her
work.
"Mother,
I
believe
I
shall
get
well,"
said
the
sick
child
in
the
evening,
"the
sun
has
shone
in
here
so
brightly
and
warmly
to-day,
and
the
little
pea
is
thriving
so
well:
I
shall
get
on
better,
too,
and
go
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
again."
"God
grant
it!"
said
the
mother,
but
she
did
not
believe
it
would
be
so.
But
she
propped
up
with
the
little
stick
the
green
plant
which
had
given
her
child
such
pleasant
hopes
of
life,
so
that
it
might
not
be
broken
by
the
winds;
she
tied
the
piece
of
string
to
the
window-sill
and
to
the
upper
part
of
the
frame,
so
that
the
pea-tendrils
might
twine
round
it
when
it
shot
up.
And
it
did
shoot
up,
indeed
it
might
almost
be
seen
to
grow
from
day
to
day.
"Now
really
here
is
a
flower
coming,"
said
the
old
woman
one
morning,
and
now
at
last
she
began
to
encourage
the
hope
that
her
sick
daughter
might
really
recover.
She
remembered
that
for
some
time
the
child
had
spoken
more
cheerfully,
and
during
the
last
few
days
had
raised
herself
in
bed
in
the
morning
to
look
with
sparkling
eyes
at
her
little
garden
which
contained
only
a
single
pea-plant.
A
week
after,
the
invalid
sat
up
for
the
first
time
a
whole
hour,
feeling
quite
happy
by
the
open
window
in
the
warm
sunshine,
while
outside
grew
the
little
plant,
and
on
it
a
pink
pea-blossom
in
full
bloom.
The
little
maiden
bent
down
and
gently
kissed
the
delicate
leaves.
This
day
was
to
her
like
a
festival.
"Our
heavenly
Father
Himself
has
planted
that
pea,
and
made
it
grow
and
flourish,
to
bring
joy
to
you
and
hope
to
me,
my
blessed
child,"
said
the
happy
mother,
and
she
smiled
at
the
flower,
as
if
it
had
been
an
angel
from
God.
But
what
became
of
the
other
peas?
Why
the
one
who
flew
out
into
the
wide
world,
and
said,
"Catch
me
if
you
can,"
fell
into
a
gutter
on
the
roof
of
a
house,
and
ended
his
travels
in
the
crop
of
a
pigeon.
The
two
lazy
ones
were
carried
quite
as
far,
for
they
also
were
eaten
by
pigeons,
so
they
were
at
least
of
some
use;
but
the
fourth,
who
wanted
to
reach
the
sun,
fell
into
a
sink
and
lay
there
in
the
dirty
water
for
days
and
weeks,
till
he
had
swelled
to
a
great
size.
"I
am
getting
beautifully
fat,"
said
the
pea,
"I
expect
I
shall
burst
at
last;
no
pea
could
do
more
that
that,
I
think;
I
am
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
five
which
were
in
the
shell."
And
the
sink
confirmed
the
opinion.
But
the
young
maiden
stood
at
the
open
garret
window,
with
sparkling
eyes
and
the
rosy
hue
of
health
on
her
cheeks,
she
folded
her
thin
hands
over
the
pea-blossom,
and
thanked
God
for
what
He
had
done.
"I,"
said
the
sink,
"shall
stand
up
for
my
pea."
