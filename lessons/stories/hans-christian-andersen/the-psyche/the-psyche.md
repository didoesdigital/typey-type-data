THE PSYCHE
In
the
fresh
morning
dawn,
in
the
rosy
air
gleams
a
great
Star,
the
brightest
Star
of
the
morning.
His
rays
tremble
on
the
white
wall,
as
if
he
wished
to
write
down
on
it
what
he
can
tell,
what
he
has
seen
there
and
elsewhere
during
thousands
of
years
in
our
rolling
world.
Let
us
hear
one
of
his
stories.
"A
short
time
ago"—the
Star's
"short
time
ago"
is
called
among
men
"centuries
ago"—"my
rays
followed
a
young
artist.
It
was
in
the
city
of
the
Popes,
in
the
world-city,
Rome.
Much
has
been
changed
there
in
the
course
of
time,
but
the
changes
have
not
come
so
quickly
as
the
change
from
youth
to
old
age.
Then
already
the
palace
of
the
Caesars
was
a
ruin,
as
it
is
now;
fig
trees
and
laurels
grew
among
the
fallen
marble
columns,
and
in
the
desolate
bathing-halls,
where
the
gilding
still
clings
to
the
wall;
the
Coliseum
was
a
gigantic
ruin;
the
church
bells
sounded,
the
incense
sent
up
its
fragrant
cloud,
and
through
the
streets
marched
processions
with
flaming
tapers
and
glowing
canopies.
Holy
Church
was
there,
and
art
was
held
as
a
high
and
holy
thing.
In
Rome
lived
the
greatest
painter
in
the
world,
Raphael;
there
also
dwelt
the
first
of
sculptors,
Michael
Angelo.
Even
the
Pope
paid
homage
to
these
two,
and
honored
them
with
a
visit.
Art
was
recognised
and
honored,
and
was
rewarded
also.
But,
for
all
that,
everything
great
and
splendid
was
not
seen
and
known.
"In
a
narrow
lane
stood
an
old
house.
Once
it
had
been
a
temple;
a
young
sculptor
now
dwelt
there.
He
was
young
and
quite
unknown.
He
certainly
had
friends,
young
artists,
like
himself,
young
in
spirit,
young
in
hopes
and
thoughts;
they
told
him
he
was
rich
in
talent,
and
an
artist,
but
that
he
was
foolish
for
having
no
faith
in
his
own
power;
for
he
always
broke
what
he
had
fashioned
out
of
clay,
and
never
completed
anything;
and
a
work
must
be
completed
if
it
is
to
be
seen
and
to
bring
money.
"'You
are
a
dreamer,'
they
went
on
to
say
to
him,
'and
that's
your
misfortune.
But
the
reason
of
this
is,
that
you
have
never
lived,
you
have
never
tasted
life,
you
have
never
enjoyed
it
in
great
wholesome
draughts,
as
it
ought
to
be
enjoyed.
In
youth
one
must
mingle
one's
own
personality
with
life,
that
they
may
become
one.
Look
at
the
great
master
Raphael,
whom
the
Pope
honors
and
the
world
admires.
He's
no
despiser
of
wine
and
bread.'
"'And
he
even
appreciates
the
baker's
daughter,
the
pretty
Fornarina,'
added
Angelo,
one
of
the
merriest
of
the
young
friends.
"Yes,
they
said
a
good
many
things
of
the
kind,
according
to
their
age
and
their
reason.
They
wanted
to
draw
the
young
artist
out
with
them
into
the
merry
wild
life,
the
mad
life
as
it
might
also
be
called;
and
at
certain
times
he
felt
an
inclination
for
it.
He
had
warm
blood,
a
strong
imagination,
and
could
take
part
in
the
merry
chat,
and
laugh
aloud
with
the
rest;
but
what
they
called
'Raphael's
merry
life'
disappeared
before
him
like
a
vapor
when
he
saw
the
divine
radiance
that
beamed
forth
from
the
pictures
of
the
great
master;
and
when
he
stood
in
the
Vatican,
before
the
forms
of
beauty
which
the
masters
had
hewn
out
of
marble
thousands
of
years
since,
his
breast
swelled,
and
he
felt
within
himself
something
high,
something
holy,
something
elevating,
great
and
good,
and
he
wished
that
he
could
produce
similar
forms
from
the
blocks
of
marble.
He
wished
to
make
a
picture
of
that
which
was
within
him,
stirring
upward
from
his
heart
to
the
realms
of
the
Infinite;
but
how,
and
in
what
form?
The
soft
clay
was
fashioned
under
his
fingers
into
forms
of
beauty,
but
the
next
day
he
broke
what
he
had
fashioned,
according
to
his
wont.
"One
day
he
walked
past
one
of
those
rich
palaces
of
which
Rome
has
many
to
show.
He
stopped
before
the
great
open
portal,
and
beheld
a
garden
surrounded
by
cloistered
walks.
The
garden
bloomed
with
a
goodly
show
of
the
fairest
roses.
Great
white
lilies
with
green
juicy
leaves
shot
upward
from
the
marble
basin
in
which
the
clear
water
was
splashing;
and
a
form
glided
past,
the
daughter
of
the
princely
house,
graceful,
delicate,
and
wonderfully
fair.
Such
a
form
of
female
loveliness
he
had
never
before
beheld—yet
stay:
he
had
seen
it,
painted
by
Raphael,
painted
as
a
Psyche,
in
one
of
the
Roman
palaces.
Yes,
there
it
had
been
painted;
but
here
it
passed
by
him
in
living
reality.
"The
remembrance
lived
in
his
thoughts,
in
his
heart.
He
went
home
to
his
humble
room,
and
modelled
a
Psyche
of
clay.
It
was
the
rich
young
Roman
girl,
the
noble
maiden;
and
for
the
first
time
he
looked
at
his
work
with
satisfaction.
It
had
a
meaning
for
him,
for
it
was
she.
And
the
friends
who
saw
his
work
shouted
aloud
for
joy;
they
declared
that
this
work
was
a
manifestation
of
his
artistic
power,
of
which
they
had
long
been
aware,
and
that
now
the
world
should
be
made
aware
of
it
too.
"The
clay
figure
was
lifelike
and
beautiful,
but
it
had
not
the
whiteness
or
the
durability
of
marble.
So
they
declared
that
the
Psyche
must
henceforth
live
in
marble.
He
already
possessed
a
costly
block
of
that
stone.
It
had
been
lying
for
years,
the
property
of
his
parents,
in
the
courtyard.
Fragments
of
glass,
climbing
weeds,
and
remains
of
artichokes
had
gathered
about
it
and
sullied
its
purity;
but
under
the
surface
the
block
was
as
white
as
the
mountain
snow;
and
from
this
block
the
Psyche
was
to
arise."
Now,
it
happened
one
morning—the
bright
Star
tells
nothing
about
this,
but
we
know
it
occurred—that
a
noble
Roman
company
came
into
the
narrow
lane.
The
carriage
stopped
at
the
top
of
the
lane,
and
the
company
proceeded
on
foot
towards
the
house,
to
inspect
the
young
sculptor's
work,
for
they
had
heard
him
spoken
of
by
chance.
And
who
were
these
distinguished
guests?
Poor
young
man!
or
fortunate
young
man
he
might
be
called.
The
noble
young
lady
stood
in
the
room
and
smiled
radiantly
when
her
father
said
to
her,
"It
is
your
living
image."
That
smile
could
not
be
copied,
any
more
than
the
look
could
be
reproduced,
the
wonderful
look
which
she
cast
upon
the
young
artist.
It
was
a
fiery
look,
that
seemed
at
once
to
elevate
and
to
crush
him.
"The
Psyche
must
be
executed
in
marble,"
said
the
wealthy
patrician.
And
those
were
words
of
life
for
the
dead
clay
and
the
heavy
block
of
marble,
and
words
of
life
likewise
for
the
deeply-moved
artist.
"When
the
work
is
finished
I
will
purchase
it,"
continued
the
rich
noble.
A
new
era
seemed
to
have
arisen
in
the
poor
studio.
Life
and
cheerfulness
gleamed
there,
and
busy
industry
plied
its
work.
The
beaming
Morning
Star
beheld
how
the
work
progressed.
The
clay
itself
seemed
inspired
since
she
had
been
there,
and
moulded
itself,
in
heightened
beauty,
to
a
likeness
of
the
well-known
features.
"Now
I
know
what
life
is,"
cried
the
artist
rejoicingly;
"it
is
Love!
It
is
the
lofty
abandonment
of
self
for
the
dawning
of
the
beautiful
in
the
soul!
What
my
friends
call
life
and
enjoyment
is
a
passing
shadow;
it
is
like
bubbles
among
seething
dregs,
not
the
pure
heavenly
wine
that
consecrates
us
to
life."
The
marble
block
was
reared
in
its
place.
The
chisel
struck
great
fragments
from
it;
the
measurements
were
taken,
points
and
lines
were
made,
the
mechanical
part
was
executed,
till
gradually
the
stone
assumed
a
human
female
form,
a
shape
of
beauty,
and
became
converted
into
the
Psyche,
fair
and
glorious—a
divine
being
in
human
shape.
The
heavy
stone
appeared
as
a
gliding,
dancing,
airy
Psyche,
with
the
heavenly
innocent
smile—the
smile
that
had
mirrored
itself
in
the
soul
of
the
young
artist.
The
Star
of
the
roseate
dawn
beheld
and
understood
what
was
stirring
within
the
young
man,
and
could
read
the
meaning
of
the
changing
color
of
his
cheek,
of
the
light
that
flashed
from
his
eye,
as
he
stood
busily
working,
reproducing
what
had
been
put
into
his
soul
from
above.
"Thou
art
a
master
like
those
masters
among
the
ancient
Greeks,"
exclaimed
his
delighted
friends;
"soon
shall
the
whole
world
admire
thy
Psyche."
"My
Psyche!"
he
repeated.
"Yes,
mine.
She
must
be
mine.
I,
too,
am
an
artist,
like
those
great
men
who
are
gone.
Providence
has
granted
me
the
boon,
and
has
made
me
the
equal
of
that
lady
of
noble
birth."
And
he
knelt
down
and
breathed
a
prayer
of
thankfulnesss
to
Heaven,
and
then
he
forgot
Heaven
for
her
sake—for
the
sake
of
her
picture
in
stone—for
her
Psyche
which
stood
there
as
if
formed
of
snow,
blushing
in
the
morning
dawn.
He
was
to
see
her
in
reality,
the
living,
graceful
Psyche,
whose
words
sounded
like
music
in
his
ears.
He
could
now
carry
the
news
into
the
rich
palace
that
the
marble
Psyche
was
finished.
He
betook
himself
thither,
strode
through
the
open
courtyard
where
the
waters
ran
splashing
from
the
dolphin's
jaws
into
the
marble
basins,
where
the
snowy
lilies
and
the
fresh
roses
bloomed
in
abundance.
He
stepped
into
the
great
lofty
hall,
whose
walls
and
ceilings
shone
with
gilding
and
bright
colors
and
heraldic
devices.
Gayly-dressed
serving-men,
adorned
with
trappings
like
sleigh
horses,
walked
to
and
fro,
and
some
reclined
at
their
ease
upon
the
carved
oak
seats,
as
if
they
were
the
masters
of
the
house.
He
told
them
what
had
brought
him
to
the
palace,
and
was
conducted
up
the
shining
marble
staircase,
covered
with
soft
carpets
and
adorned
with
many
a
statue.
Then
he
went
on
through
richly-furnished
chambers,
over
mosaic
floors,
amid
gorgeous
pictures.
All
this
pomp
and
luxury
seemed
to
weary
him;
but
soon
he
felt
relieved,
for
the
princely
old
master
of
the
house
received
him
most
graciously,
almost
heartily;
and
when
he
took
his
leave
he
was
requested
to
step
into
the
Signora's
apartment,
for
she,
too,
wished
to
see
him.
The
servants
led
him
through
more
luxurious
halls
and
chambers
into
her
room,
where
she
appeared
the
chief
and
leading
ornament.
She
spoke
to
him.
No
hymn
of
supplication,
no
holy
chant,
could
melt
his
soul
like
the
sound
of
her
voice.
He
took
her
hand
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips.
No
rose
was
softer,
but
a
fire
thrilled
through
him
from
this
rose—a
feeling
of
power
came
upon
him,
and
words
poured
from
his
tongue—he
knew
not
what
he
said.
Does
the
crater
of
the
volcano
know
that
the
glowing
lava
is
pouring
from
it?
He
confessed
what
he
felt
for
her.
She
stood
before
him
astonished,
offended,
proud,
with
contempt
in
her
face,
an
expression
of
disgust,
as
if
she
had
suddenly
touched
a
cold
unclean
reptile.
Her
cheeks
reddened,
her
lips
grew
white,
and
her
eyes
flashed
fire,
though
they
were
dark
as
the
blackness
of
night.
"Madman!"
she
cried,
"away!
begone!"
And
she
turned
her
back
upon
him.
Her
beautiful
face
wore
an
expression
like
that
of
the
stony
countenance
with
the
snaky
locks.
Like
a
stricken,
fainting
man,
he
tottered
down
the
staircase
and
out
into
the
street.
Like
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep,
he
found
his
way
back
to
his
dwelling.
Then
he
woke
up
to
madness
and
agony,
and
seized
his
hammer,
swung
it
high
in
the
air,
and
rushed
forward
to
shatter
the
beautiful
marble
image.
But,
in
his
pain,
he
had
not
noticed
that
his
friend
Angelo
stood
beside
him;
and
Angelo
held
back
his
arm
with
a
strong
grasp,
crying,
"Are
you
mad?
What
are
you
about?"
They
struggled
together.
Angelo
was
the
stronger;
and,
with
a
deep
sigh
of
exhaustion,
the
young
artist
threw
himself
into
a
chair.
"What
has
happened?"
asked
Angelo.
"Command
yourself.
Speak!"
But
what
could
he
say?
How
could
he
explain?
And
as
Angelo
could
make
no
sense
of
his
friend's
incoherent
words,
he
forbore
to
question
him
further,
and
merely
said,
"Your
blood
grows
thick
from
your
eternal
dreaming.
Be
a
man,
as
all
others
are,
and
don't
go
on
living
in
ideals,
for
that
is
what
drives
men
crazy.
A
jovial
feast
will
make
you
sleep
quietly
and
happily.
Believe
me,
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
be
old,
and
your
sinews
will
shrink,
and
then,
on
some
fine
sunshiny
day,
when
everything
is
laughing
and
rejoicing,
you
will
lie
there
a
faded
plant,
that
will
grow
no
more.
I
do
not
live
in
dreams,
but
in
reality.
Come
with
me.
Be
a
man!"
And
he
drew
the
artist
away
with
him.
At
this
moment
he
was
able
to
do
so,
for
a
fire
ran
in
the
blood
of
the
young
sculptor;
a
change
had
taken
place
in
his
soul;
he
felt
a
longing
to
tear
from
the
old,
the
accustomed—to
forget,
if
possible,
his
own
individuality;
and
therefore
it
was
that
he
followed
Angelo.
In
an
out-of-the-way
suburb
of
Rome
lay
a
tavern
much
visited
by
artists.
It
was
built
on
the
ruins
of
some
ancient
baths.
The
great
yellow
citrons
hung
down
among
the
dark
shining
leaves,
and
covered
a
part
of
the
old
reddish-yellow
walls.
The
tavern
consisted
of
a
vaulted
chamber,
almost
like
a
cavern,
in
the
ruins.
A
lamp
burned
there
before
the
picture
of
the
Madonna.
A
great
fire
gleamed
on
the
hearth,
and
roasting
and
boiling
was
going
on
there;
without,
under
the
citron
trees
and
laurels,
stood
a
few
covered
tables.
The
two
artists
were
received
by
their
friends
with
shouts
of
welcome.
Little
was
eaten,
but
much
was
drunk,
and
the
spirits
of
the
company
rose.
Songs
were
sung
and
ditties
were
played
on
the
guitar;
presently
the
Salterello
sounded,
and
the
merry
dance
began.
Two
young
Roman
girls,
who
sat
as
models
to
the
artists,
took
part
in
the
dance
and
in
the
festivity.
Two
charming
Bacchantes
were
they;
certainly
not
Psyches—not
delicate,
beautiful
roses,
but
fresh,
hearty,
glowing
carnations.
How
hot
it
was
on
that
day!
Even
after
sundown
it
was
hot.
There
was
fire
in
the
blood,
fire
in
every
glance,
fire
everywhere.
The
air
gleamed
with
gold
and
roses,
and
life
seemed
like
gold
and
roses.
"At
last
you
have
joined
us,
for
once,"
said
his
friends.
"Now
let
yourself
be
carried
by
the
waves
within
and
around
you."
"Never
yet
have
I
felt
so
well,
so
merry!"
cried
the
young
artist.
"You
are
right—you
are
all
of
you
right.
I
was
a
fool—a
dreamer.
Man
belongs
to
reality,
and
not
to
fancy."
With
songs
and
with
sounding
guitars
the
young
people
returned
that
evening
from
the
tavern,
through
the
narrow
streets;
the
two
glowing
carnations,
daughters
of
the
Campagna,
went
with
them.
In
Angelo's
room,
among
a
litter
of
colored
sketches
(studies)
and
glowing
pictures,
the
voices
sounded
mellower,
but
not
less
merrily.
On
the
ground
lay
many
a
sketch
that
resembled
the
daughters
of
the
Campagna,
in
their
fresh,
hearty
comeliness,
but
the
two
originals
were
far
handsomer
than
their
portraits.
All
the
burners
of
the
six-armed
lamp
flared
and
flamed;
and
the
human
flamed
up
from
within,
and
appeared
in
the
glare
as
if
it
were
divine.
"Apollo!
Jupiter!
I
feel
myself
raised
to
our
heaven—to
your
glory!
I
feel
as
if
the
blossom
of
life
were
unfolding
itself
in
my
veins
at
this
moment!"
Yes,
the
blossom
unfolded
itself,
and
then
burst
and
fell,
and
an
evil
vapor
arose
from
it,
blinding
the
sight,
leading
astray
the
fancy;
the
firework
of
the
senses
went
out,
and
it
became
dark.
He
was
again
in
his
own
room.
There
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
collected
his
thoughts.
"Fie
on
thee!"
these
were
the
words
that
sounded
out
of
his
mouth
from
the
depths
of
his
heart.
"Wretched
man,
go,
begone!"
And
a
deep
painful
sigh
burst
from
his
bosom.
"Away!
begone!"
These,
her
words,
the
words
of
the
living
Psyche,
echoed
through
his
heart,
escaped
from
his
lips.
He
buried
his
head
in
the
pillows,
his
thoughts
grew
confused,
and
he
fell
asleep.
In
the
morning
dawn
he
started
up,
and
collected
his
thoughts
anew.
What
had
happened?
Had
all
the
past
been
a
dream?
The
visit
to
her,
the
feast
at
the
tavern,
the
evening
with
the
purple
carnations
of
the
Campagna?
No,
it
was
all
real—a
reality
he
had
never
before
experienced.
In
the
purple
air
gleamed
the
bright
Star,
and
its
beams
fell
upon
him
and
upon
the
marble
Psyche.
He
trembled
as
he
looked
at
that
picture
of
immortality,
and
his
glance
seemed
impure
to
him.
He
threw
the
cloth
over
the
statue,
and
then
touched
it
once
more
to
unveil
the
form—but
he
was
not
able
to
look
again
at
his
own
work.
Gloomy,
quiet,
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts,
he
sat
there
through
the
long
day;
he
heard
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him,
and
no
man
guessed
what
was
passing
in
this
human
soul.
And
days
and
weeks
went
by,
but
the
nights
passed
more
slowly
than
the
days.
The
flashing
Star
beheld
him
one
morning
as
he
rose,
pale
and
trembling
with
fever,
from
his
sad
couch;
then
he
stepped
towards
the
statue,
threw
back
the
covering,
took
one
long,
sorrowful
gaze
at
his
work,
and
then,
almost
sinking
beneath
the
burden,
he
dragged
the
statue
out
into
the
garden.
In
that
place
was
an
old
dry
well,
now
nothing
but
a
hole.
Into
this
he
cast
the
Psyche,
threw
earth
in
above
her,
and
covered
up
the
spot
with
twigs
and
nettles.
"Away!
begone!"
Such
was
the
short
epitaph
he
spoke.
The
Star
beheld
all
this
from
the
pink
morning
sky,
and
its
beam
trembled
upon
two
great
tears
upon
the
pale
feverish
cheeks
of
the
young
man;
and
soon
it
was
said
that
he
was
sick
unto
death,
and
he
lay
stretched
upon
a
bed
of
pain.
The
convent
Brother
Ignatius
visited
him
as
a
physician
and
a
friend,
and
brought
him
words
of
comfort,
of
religion,
and
spoke
to
him
of
the
peace
and
happiness
of
the
church,
of
the
sinfulness
of
man,
of
rest
and
mercy
to
be
found
in
heaven.
And
the
words
fell
like
warm
sunbeams
upon
a
teeming
soil.
The
soil
smoked
and
sent
up
clouds
of
mist,
fantastic
pictures,
pictures
in
which
there
was
reality;
and
from
these
floating
islands
he
looked
across
at
human
life.
He
found
it
vanity
and
delusion—and
vanity
and
delusion
it
had
been
to
him.
They
told
him
that
art
was
a
sorcerer,
betraying
us
to
vanity
and
to
earthly
lusts;
that
we
are
false
to
ourselves,
unfaithful
to
our
friends,
unfaithful
towards
Heaven;
and
that
the
serpent
was
always
repeating
within
us,
"Eat,
and
thou
shalt
become
as
God."
And
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
now,
for
the
first
time,
he
knew
himself,
and
had
found
the
way
that
leads
to
truth
and
to
peace.
In
the
church
was
the
light
and
the
brightness
of
God—in
the
monk's
cell
he
should
find
the
rest
through
which
the
tree
of
human
life
might
grow
on
into
eternity.
Brother
Ignatius
strengthened
his
longings,
and
the
determination
became
firm
within
him.
A
child
of
the
world
became
a
servant
of
the
church—the
young
artist
renounced
the
world,
and
retired
into
the
cloister.
The
brothers
came
forward
affectionately
to
welcome
him,
and
his
inauguration
was
as
a
Sunday
feast.
Heaven
seemed
to
him
to
dwell
in
the
sunshine
of
the
church,
and
to
beam
upon
him
from
the
holy
pictures
and
from
the
cross.
And
when,
in
the
evening,
at
the
sunset
hour,
he
stood
in
his
little
cell,
and,
opening
the
window,
looked
out
upon
old
Rome,
upon
the
desolated
temples,
and
the
great
dead
Coliseum—when
he
saw
all
this
in
its
spring
garb,
when
the
acacias
bloomed,
and
the
ivy
was
fresh,
and
roses
burst
forth
everywhere,
and
the
citron
and
orange
were
in
the
height
of
their
beauty,
and
the
palm
trees
waved
their
branches—then
he
felt
a
deeper
emotion
than
had
ever
yet
thrilled
through
him.
The
quiet
open
Campagna
spread
itself
forth
towards
the
blue
snow-covered
mountains,
which
seemed
to
be
painted
in
the
air;
all
the
outlines
melting
into
each
other,
breathing
peace
and
beauty,
floating,
dreaming—and
all
appearing
like
a
dream!
Yes,
this
world
was
a
dream,
and
the
dream
lasts
for
hours,
and
may
return
for
hours;
but
convent
life
is
a
life
of
years—long
years,
and
many
years.
From
within
comes
much
that
renders
men
sinful
and
impure.
He
fully
realized
the
truth
of
this.
What
flames
arose
up
in
him
at
times!
What
a
source
of
evil,
of
that
which
we
would
not,
welled
up
continually!
He
mortified
his
body,
but
the
evil
came
from
within.
One
day,
after
the
lapse
of
many
years,
he
met
Angelo,
who
recognised
him.
"Man!"
exclaimed
Angelo.
"Yes,
it
is
thou!
Art
thou
happy
now?
Thou
hast
sinned
against
God,
and
cast
away
His
boon
from
thee—hast
neglected
thy
mission
in
this
world!
Read
the
parable
of
the
intrusted
talent!
The
MASTER,
who
spoke
that
parable,
spoke
the
truth!
What
hast
thou
gained?
What
hast
thou
found?
Dost
thou
not
fashion
for
thyself
a
religion
and
a
dreamy
life
after
thine
own
idea,
as
almost
all
do?
Suppose
all
this
is
a
dream,
a
fair
delusion!"
"Get
thee
away
from
me,
Satan!"
said
the
monk;
and
he
quitted
Angelo.
"There
is
a
devil,
a
personal
devil!
This
day
I
have
seen
him!"
said
the
monk
to
himself.
"Once
I
extended
a
finger
to
him,
and
he
took
my
whole
hand.
But
now,"
he
sighed,
"the
evil
is
within
me,
and
it
is
in
yonder
man;
but
it
does
not
bow
him
down;
he
goes
abroad
with
head
erect,
and
enjoys
his
comfort;
and
I
grasped
at
comfort
in
the
consolations
of
religion.
If
it
were
nothing
but
a
consolation?
Supposing
everything
here
were,
like
the
world
I
have
quitted,
only
a
beautiful
fancy,
a
delusion
like
the
beauty
of
the
evening
clouds,
like
the
misty
blue
of
the
distant
hills!—when
you
approach
them,
they
are
very
different!
O
eternity!
Thou
actest
like
the
great
calm
ocean,
that
beckons
us,
and
fills
us
with
expectation—and
when
we
embark
upon
thee,
we
sink,
disappear,
and
cease
to
be.
Delusion!
away
with
it!
begone!"
And
tearless,
but
sunk
in
bitter
reflection,
he
sat
upon
his
hard
couch,
and
then
knelt
down—before
whom?
Before
the
stone
cross
fastened
to
the
wall?
No,
it
was
only
habit
that
made
him
take
this
position.
The
more
deeply
he
looked
into
his
own
heart,
the
blacker
did
the
darkness
seem.
"Nothing
within,
nothing
without—this
life
squandered
and
cast
away!"
And
this
thought
rolled
and
grew
like
a
snowball,
until
it
seemed
to
crush
him.
"I
can
confide
my
griefs
to
none.
I
may
speak
to
none
of
the
gnawing
worm
within.
My
secret
is
my
prisoner;
if
I
let
the
captive
escape,
I
shall
be
his!"
And
the
godlike
power
that
dwelt
within
him
suffered
and
strove.
"O
Lord,
my
Lord!"
he
cried,
in
his
despair,
"be
merciful
and
grant
me
faith.
I
threw
away
the
gift
thou
hadst
vouchsafed
to
me,
I
left
my
mission
unfulfilled.
I
lacked
strength,
and
strength
thou
didst
not
give
me.
Immortality—the
Psyche
in
my
breast—away
with
it!—it
shall
be
buried
like
that
Psyche,
the
best
gleam
of
my
life;
never
will
it
arise
out
of
its
grave!"
The
Star
glowed
in
the
roseate
air,
the
Star
that
shall
surely
be
extinguished
and
pass
away
while
the
soul
still
lives
on;
its
trembling
beam
fell
upon
the
white
wall,
but
it
wrote
nothing
there
upon
being
made
perfect
in
God,
nothing
of
the
hope
of
mercy,
of
the
reliance
on
the
divine
love
that
thrills
through
the
heart
of
the
believer.
"The
Psyche
within
can
never
die.
Shall
it
live
in
consciousness?
Can
the
incomprehensible
happen?
Yes,
yes.
My
being
is
incomprehensible.
Thou
art
unfathomable,
O
Lord.
Thy
whole
world
is
incomprehensible—a
wonder-work
of
power,
of
glory
and
of
love."
His
eyes
gleamed,
and
then
closed
in
death.
The
tolling
of
the
church
bell
was
the
last
sound
that
echoed
above
him,
above
the
dead
man;
and
they
buried
him,
covering
him
with
earth
that
had
been
brought
from
Jerusalem,
and
in
which
was
mingled
the
dust
of
many
of
the
pious
dead.
When
years
had
gone
by
his
skeleton
was
dug
up,
as
the
skeletons
of
the
monks
who
had
died
before
him
had
been;
it
was
clad
in
a
brown
frock,
a
rosary
was
put
into
the
bony
hand,
and
the
form
was
placed
among
the
ranks
of
other
skeletons
in
the
cloisters
of
the
convent.
And
the
sun
shone
without,
while
within
the
censers
were
waved
and
the
Mass
was
celebrated.
And
years
rolled
by.
The
bones
fell
asunder
and
became
mingled
with
others.
Skulls
were
piled
up
till
they
formed
an
outer
wall
around
the
church;
and
there
lay
also
his
head
in
the
burning
sun,
for
many
dead
were
there,
and
no
one
knew
their
names,
and
his
name
was
forgotten
also.
And
see,
something
was
moving
in
the
sunshine,
in
the
sightless
cavernous
eyes!
What
might
that
be?
A
sparkling
lizard
moved
about
in
the
skull,
gliding
in
and
out
through
the
sightless
holes.
The
lizard
now
represented
all
the
life
left
in
that
head,
in
which
once
great
thoughts,
bright
dreams,
the
love
of
art
and
of
the
glorious,
had
arisen,
whence
hot
tears
had
rolled
down,
where
hope
and
immortality
had
had
their
being.
The
lizard
sprang
away
and
disappeared,
and
the
skull
itself
crumbled
to
pieces
and
became
dust
among
dust.
Centuries
passed
away.
The
bright
Star
gleamed
unaltered,
radiant
and
large,
as
it
had
gleamed
for
thousands
of
years,
and
the
air
glowed
red
with
tints
fresh
as
roses,
crimson
like
blood.
There,
where
once
had
stood
the
narrow
lane
containing
the
ruins
of
the
temple,
a
nunnery
was
now
built.
A
grave
was
being
dug
in
the
convent
garden
for
a
young
nun
who
had
died,
and
was
to
be
laid
in
the
earth
this
morning.
The
spade
struck
against
a
hard
substance;
it
was
a
stone,
that
shone
dazzling
white.
A
block
of
marble
soon
appeared,
a
rounded
shoulder
was
laid
bare;
and
now
the
spade
was
plied
with
a
more
careful
hand,
and
presently
a
female
head
was
seen,
and
butterflies'
wings.
Out
of
the
grave
in
which
the
young
nun
was
to
be
laid
they
lifted,
in
the
rosy
morning,
a
wonderful
statue
of
a
Psyche
carved
in
white
marble.
"How
beautiful,
how
perfect
it
is!"
cried
the
spectators.
"A
relic
of
the
best
period
of
art."
And
who
could
the
sculptor
have
been?
No
one
knew;
no
one
remembered
him,
except
the
bright
star
that
had
gleamed
for
thousands
of
years.
The
star
had
seen
the
course
of
that
life
on
earth,
and
knew
of
the
man's
trials,
of
his
weakness—in
fact,
that
he
had
been
but
human.
The
man's
life
had
passed
away,
his
dust
had
been
scattered
abroad
as
dust
is
destined
to
be;
but
the
result
of
his
noblest
striving,
the
glorious
work
that
gave
token
of
the
divine
element
within
him—the
Psyche
that
never
dies,
that
lives
beyond
posterity—the
brightness
even
of
this
earthly
Psyche
remained
here
after
him,
and
was
seen
and
acknowledged
and
appreciated.
The
bright
Morning
Star
in
the
roseate
air
threw
its
glancing
ray
downward
upon
the
Psyche,
and
upon
the
radiant
countenances
of
the
admiring
spectators,
who
here
beheld
the
image
of
the
soul
portrayed
in
marble.
What
is
earthly
will
pass
away
and
be
forgotten,
and
the
Star
in
the
vast
firmament
knows
it.
What
is
heavenly
will
shine
brightly
through
posterity;
and
when
the
ages
of
posterity
are
past,
the
Psyche—the
soul—will
still
live
on!
