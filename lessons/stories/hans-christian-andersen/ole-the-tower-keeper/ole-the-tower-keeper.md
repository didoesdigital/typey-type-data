OLE THE TOWER-KEEPER
"In
the
world
it's
always
going
up
and
down;
and
now
I
can't
go
up
any
higher!"
So
said
Ole
the
tower-keeper.
"Most
people
have
to
try
both
the
ups
and
the
downs;
and,
rightly
considered,
we
all
get
to
be
watchmen
at
last,
and
look
down
upon
life
from
a
height."
Such
was
the
speech
of
Ole,
my
friend,
the
old
tower-keeper,
a
strange,
talkative
old
fellow,
who
seemed
to
speak
out
everything
that
came
into
his
head,
and
who
for
all
that
had
many
a
serious
thought
deep
in
his
heart.
Yes,
he
was
the
child
of
respectable
people,
and
there
were
even
some
who
said
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
privy
councillor,
or
that
he
might
have
been.
He
had
studied,
too,
and
had
been
assistant
teacher
and
deputy
clerk;
but
of
what
service
was
all
that
to
him?
In
those
days
he
lived
in
the
clerk's
house,
and
was
to
have
everything
in
the
house—to
be
at
free
quarters,
as
the
saying
is;
but
he
was
still,
so
to
speak,
a
fine
young
gentleman.
He
wanted
to
have
his
boots
cleaned
with
patent
blacking,
and
the
clerk
could
only
afford
ordinary
grease;
and
upon
that
point
they
split.
One
spoke
of
stinginess,
the
other
of
vanity,
and
the
blacking
became
the
black
cause
of
enmity
between
them,
and
at
last
they
parted.
This
is
what
he
demanded
of
the
world
in
general,
namely,
patent
blacking,
and
he
got
nothing
but
grease.
Accordingly,
he
at
last
drew
back
from
all
men,
and
became
a
hermit;
but
the
church
tower
is
the
only
place
in
a
great
city
where
hermitage,
office
and
bread
can
be
found
together.
So
he
betook
himself
up
thither,
and
smoked
his
pipe
as
he
made
his
solitary
rounds.
He
looked
upward
and
downward,
and
had
his
own
thoughts,
and
told
in
his
own
way
of
what
he
read
in
books
and
in
himself.
I
often
lent
him
books—good
books;
and
you
may
know
by
the
company
he
keeps.
He
loved
neither
the
English
governess
novels
nor
the
French
ones,
which
he
called
a
mixture
of
empty
wind
and
raisin-stalks:
he
wanted
biographies,
and
descriptions
of
the
wonders
of,
the
world.
I
visited
him
at
least
once
a
year,
generally
directly
after
New
Year's
day,
and
then
he
always
spoke
of
this
and
that
which
the
change
of
the
year
had
put
into
his
head.
I
will
tell
the
story
of
three
of
these
visits,
and
will
reproduce
his
own
words
whenever
I
can
remember
them.
FIRST
VISIT
Among
the
books
which
I
had
lately
lent
Ole,
was
one
which
had
greatly
rejoiced
and
occupied
him.
It
was
a
geological
book,
containing
an
account
of
the
boulders.
"Yes,
they're
rare
old
fellows,
those
boulders!"
he
said;
"and
to
think
that
we
should
pass
them
without
noticing
them!
And
over
the
street
pavement,
the
paving
stones,
those
fragments
of
the
oldest
remains
of
antiquity,
one
walks
without
ever
thinking
about
them.
I
have
done
the
very
thing
myself.
But
now
I
look
respectfully
at
every
paving-stone.
Many
thanks
for
the
book!
It
has
filled
me
with
thought,
and
has
made
me
long
to
read
more
on
the
subject.
The
romance
of
the
earth
is,
after
all,
the
most
wonderful
of
all
romances.
It's
a
pity
one
can't
read
the
first
volume
of
it,
because
it
is
written
in
a
language
that
we
don't
understand.
One
must
read
in
the
different
strata,
in
the
pebble-stones,
for
each
separate
period.
Yes,
it
is
a
romance,
a
very
wonderful
romance,
and
we
all
have
our
place
in
it.
We
grope
and
ferret
about,
and
yet
remain
where
we
are;
but
the
ball
keeps
turning,
without
emptying
the
ocean
over
us;
the
clod
on
which
we
move
about,
holds,
and
does
not
let
us
through.
And
then
it's
a
story
that
has
been
acting
for
thousands
upon
thousands
of
years
and
is
still
going
on.
My
best
thanks
for
the
book
about
the
boulders.
Those
are
fellows
indeed!
They
could
tell
us
something
worth
hearing,
if
they
only
knew
how
to
talk.
It's
really
a
pleasure
now
and
then
to
become
a
mere
nothing,
especially
when
a
man
is
as
highly
placed
as
I
am.
And
then
to
think
that
we
all,
even
with
patent
lacquer,
are
nothing
more
than
insects
of
a
moment
on
that
ant-hill
the
earth,
though
we
may
be
insects
with
stars
and
garters,
places
and
offices!
One
feels
quite
a
novice
beside
these
venerable
million-year-old
boulders.
On
last
New
Year's
eve
I
was
reading
the
book,
and
had
lost
myself
in
it
so
completely,
that
I
forgot
my
usual
New
Year's
diversion,
namely,
the
wild
hunt
to
Amack.
Ah,
you
don't
know
what
that
is!
"The
journey
of
the
witches
on
broomsticks
is
well
enough
known—that
journey
is
taken
on
St.
John's
eve,
to
the
Brocken;
but
we
have
a
wild
journey,
also
which
is
national
and
modern,
and
that
is
the
journey
to
Amack
on
the
night
of
the
New
Year.
All
indifferent
poets
and
poetesses,
musicians,
newspaper
writers,
and
artistic
notabilities,—I
mean
those
who
are
no
good,—ride
in
the
New
Year's
night
through
the
air
to
Amack.
They
sit
backwards
on
their
painting
brushes
or
quill
pens,
for
steel
pens
won't
bear
them—they're
too
stiff.
As
I
told
you,
I
see
that
every
New
Year's
night,
and
could
mention
the
majority
of
the
riders
by
name,
but
I
should
not
like
to
draw
their
enmity
upon
myself,
for
they
don't
like
people
to
talk
about
their
ride
to
Amack
on
quill
pens.
I've
a
kind
of
niece,
who
is
a
fishwife,
and
who,
as
she
tells
me,
supplies
three
respectable
newspapers
with
the
terms
of
abuse
and
vituperation
they
use,
and
she
has
herself
been
at
Amack
as
an
invited
guest;
but
she
was
carried
out
thither,
for
she
does
not
own
a
quill
pen,
nor
can
she
ride.
She
has
told
me
all
about
it.
Half
of
what
she
said
is
not
true,
but
the
other
half
gives
us
information
enough.
When
she
was
out
there,
the
festivities
began
with
a
song;
each
of
the
guests
had
written
his
own
song,
and
each
one
sang
his
own
song,
for
he
thought
that
the
best,
and
it
was
all
one,
all
the
same
melody.
Then
those
came
marching
up,
in
little
bands,
who
are
only
busy
with
their
mouths.
There
were
ringing
bells
that
rang
alternately;
and
then
came
the
little
drummers
that
beat
their
tattoo
in
the
family
circle;
and
acquaintance
was
made
with
those
who
write
without
putting
their
names,
which
here
means
as
much
as
using
grease
instead
of
patent
blacking;
and
then
there
was
the
beadle
with
his
boy,
and
the
boy
was
worst
off,
for
in
general
he
gets
no
notice
taken
of
him;
then,
too,
there
was
the
good
street
sweeper
with
his
cart,
who
turns
over
the
dust-bin,
and
calls
it
'good,
very
good,
remarkably
good.'
And
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasure
that
was
afforded
by
the
mere
meeting
of
these
folks,
there
shot
up
out
of
the
great
dirt-heap
at
Amack
a
stem,
a
tree,
an
immense
flower,
a
great
mushroom,
a
perfect
roof,
which
formed
a
sort
of
warehouse
for
the
worthy
company,
for
in
it
hung
everything
they
had
given
to
the
world
during
the
Old
Year.
Out
of
the
tree
poured
sparks
like
flames
of
fire;
these
were
the
ideas
and
thoughts,
borrowed
from
others,
which
they
had
used,
and
which
now
got
free
and
rushed
away
like
so
many
fireworks.
They
played
at
'the
stick
burns,'
and
the
young
poets
played
at
'heart-burns,'
and
the
witlings
played
off
their
jests,
and
the
jests
rolled
away
with
a
thundering
sound,
as
if
empty
pots
were
being
shattered
against
doors.
'It
was
very
amusing!'
my
niece
said;
in
fact,
she
said
many
things
that
were
very
malicious
but
very
amusing,
but
I
won't
mention
them,
for
a
man
must
be
good-natured,
and
not
a
carping
critic.
But
you
will
easily
perceive
that
when
a
man
once
knows
the
rights
of
the
journey
to
Amack,
as
I
know
them,
it's
quite
natural
that
on
the
New
Year's
night
one
should
look
out
to
see
the
wild
chase
go
by.
If
in
the
New
Year
I
miss
certain
persons
who
used
to
be
there,
I
am
sure
to
notice
others
who
are
new
arrivals;
but
this
year
I
omitted
taking
my
look
at
the
guests,
I
bowled
away
on
the
boulders,
rolled
back
through
millions
of
years,
and
saw
the
stones
break
loose
high
up
in
the
north,
saw
them
drifting
about
on
icebergs,
long
before
Noah's
ark
was
constructed,
saw
them
sink
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea,
and
re-appear
with
a
sand-bank,
with
that
one
that
peered
forth
from
the
flood
and
said,
'This
shall
be
Zealand!'
I
saw
them
become
the
dwelling-place
of
birds
that
are
unknown
to
us,
and
then
become
the
seat
of
wild
chiefs
of
whom
we
know
nothing,
until
with
their
axes
they
cut
their
Runic
signs
into
a
few
of
these
stones,
which
then
came
into
the
calendar
of
time.
But
as
for
me,
I
had
gone
quite
beyond
all
lapse
of
time,
and
had
become
a
cipher
and
a
nothing.
Then
three
or
four
beautiful
falling
stars
came
down,
which
cleared
the
air,
and
gave
my
thoughts
another
direction.
You
know
what
a
falling
star
is,
do
you
not?
The
learned
men
are
not
at
all
clear
about
it.
I
have
my
own
ideas
about
shooting
stars,
as
the
common
people
in
many
parts
call
them,
and
my
idea
is
this:
How
often
are
silent
thanksgivings
offered
up
for
one
who
has
done
a
good
and
noble
action!
The
thanks
are
often
speechless,
but
they
are
not
lost
for
all
that.
I
think
these
thanks
are
caught
up,
and
the
sunbeams
bring
the
silent,
hidden
thankfulness
over
the
head
of
the
benefactor;
and
if
it
be
a
whole
people
that
has
been
expressing
its
gratitude
through
a
long
lapse
of
time,
the
thankfulness
appears
as
a
nosegay
of
flowers,
and
at
length
falls
in
the
form
of
a
shooting
star
over
the
good
man's
grave.
I
am
always
very
much
pleased
when
I
see
a
shooting
star,
especially
in
the
New
Year's
night,
and
then
find
out
for
whom
the
gift
of
gratitude
was
intended.
Lately
a
gleaming
star
fell
in
the
southwest,
as
a
tribute
of
thanksgiving
to
many—many!
'For
whom
was
that
star
intended?'
thought
I.
It
fell,
no
doubt,
on
the
hill
by
the
Bay
of
Plensberg,
where
the
Danebrog
waves
over
the
graves
of
Schleppegrell,
Lasloes,
and
their
comrades.
One
star
also
fell
in
the
midst
of
the
land,
fell
upon
Soro,
a
flower
on
the
grave
of
Holberg,
the
thanks
of
the
year
from
a
great
many—thanks
for
his
charming
plays!
"It
is
a
great
and
pleasant
thought
to
know
that
a
shooting
star
falls
upon
our
graves.
On
mine
certainly
none
will
fall—no
sunbeam
brings
thanks
to
me,
for
here
there
is
nothing
worthy
of
thanks.
I
shall
not
get
the
patent
lacquer,"
said
Ole,
"for
my
fate
on
earth
is
only
grease,
after
all."
SECOND
VISIT
It
was
New
Year's
day,
and
I
went
up
on
the
tower.
Ole
spoke
of
the
toasts
that
were
drunk
on
the
transition
from
the
Old
Year
into
the
New—from
one
grave
into
the
other,
as
he
said.
And
he
told
me
a
story
about
the
glasses,
and
this
story
had
a
very
deep
meaning.
It
was
this:
"When
on
the
New
Year's
night
the
clock
strikes
twelve,
the
people
at
the
table
rise
up
with
full
glasses
in
their
hands,
and
drain
these
glasses,
and
drink
success
to
the
New
Year.
They
begin
the
year
with
the
glass
in
their
hands;
that
is
a
good
beginning
for
drunkards.
They
begin
the
New
Year
by
going
to
bed,
and
that's
a
good
beginning
for
drones.
Sleep
is
sure
to
play
a
great
part
in
the
New
Year,
and
the
glass
likewise.
Do
you
know
what
dwells
in
the
glass?"
asked
Ole.
"I
will
tell
you.
There
dwell
in
the
glass,
first,
health,
and
then
pleasure,
then
the
most
complete
sensual
delight;
and
misfortune
and
the
bitterest
woe
dwell
in
the
glass
also.
Now,
suppose
we
count
the
glasses—of
course
I
count
the
different
degrees
in
the
glasses
for
different
people.
"You
see,
the
first
glass,
that's
the
glass
of
health,
and
in
that
the
herb
of
health
is
found
growing.
Put
it
up
on
the
beam
in
the
ceiling,
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
you
may
be
sitting
in
the
arbor
of
health.
"If
you
take
the
second
glass—from
this
a
little
bird
soars
upward,
twittering
in
guileless
cheerfulness,
so
that
a
man
may
listen
to
his
song,
and
perhaps
join
in
'Fair
is
life!
no
downcast
looks!
Take
courage,
and
march
onward!'
"Out
of
the
third
glass
rises
a
little
winged
urchin,
who
cannot
certainly
be
called
an
angel
child,
for
there
is
goblin
blood
in
his
veins,
and
he
has
the
spirit
of
a
goblin—not
wishing
to
hurt
or
harm
you,
indeed,
but
very
ready
to
play
off
tricks
upon
you.
He'll
sit
at
your
ear
and
whisper
merry
thoughts
to
you;
he'll
creep
into
your
heart
and
warm
you,
so
that
you
grow
very
merry,
and
become
a
wit,
so
far
as
the
wits
of
the
others
can
judge.
"In
the
fourth
glass
is
neither
herb,
bird,
nor
urchin.
In
that
glass
is
the
pause
drawn
by
reason,
and
one
may
never
go
beyond
that
sign.
"Take
the
fifth
glass,
and
you
will
weep
at
yourself,
you
will
feel
such
a
deep
emotion;
or
it
will
affect
you
in
a
different
way.
Out
of
the
glass
there
will
spring
with
a
bang
Prince
Carnival,
nine
times
and
extravagantly
merry.
He'll
draw
you
away
with
him;
you'll
forget
your
dignity,
if
you
have
any,
and
you'll
forget
more
than
you
should
or
ought
to
forget.
All
is
dance,
song
and
sound:
the
masks
will
carry
you
away
with
them,
and
the
daughters
of
vanity,
clad
in
silk
and
satin,
will
come
with
loose
hair
and
alluring
charms;
but
tear
yourself
away
if
you
can!
"The
sixth
glass!
Yes,
in
that
glass
sits
a
demon,
in
the
form
of
a
little,
well
dressed,
attractive
and
very
fascinating
man,
who
thoroughly
understands
you,
agrees
with
you
in
everything,
and
becomes
quite
a
second
self
to
you.
He
has
a
lantern
with
him,
to
give
you
light
as
he
accompanies
you
home.
There
is
an
old
legend
about
a
saint
who
was
allowed
to
choose
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins,
and
who
accordingly
chose
drunkenness,
which
appeared
to
him
the
least,
but
which
led
him
to
commit
all
the
other
six.
The
man's
blood
is
mingled
with
that
of
the
demon.
It
is
the
sixth
glass,
and
with
that
the
germ
of
all
evil
shoots
up
within
us;
and
each
one
grows
up
with
a
strength
like
that
of
the
grains
of
mustard-seed,
and
shoots
up
into
a
tree,
and
spreads
over
the
whole
world:
and
most
people
have
no
choice
but
to
go
into
the
oven,
to
be
re-cast
in
a
new
form.
"That's
the
history
of
the
glasses,"
said
the
tower-keeper
Ole,
"and
it
can
be
told
with
lacquer
or
only
with
grease;
but
I
give
it
you
with
both!"
THIRD
VISIT
On
this
occasion
I
chose
the
general
"moving-day"
for
my
visit
to
Ole,
for
on
that
day
it
is
anything
but
agreeable
down
in
the
streets
in
the
town;
for
they
are
full
of
sweepings,
shreds,
and
remnants
of
all
sorts,
to
say
nothing
of
the
cast-off
rubbish
in
which
one
has
to
wade
about.
But
this
time
I
happened
to
see
two
children
playing
in
this
wilderness
of
sweepings.
They
were
playing
at
"going
to
bed,"
for
the
occasion
seemed
especially
favorable
for
this
sport.
They
crept
under
the
straw,
and
drew
an
old
bit
of
ragged
curtain
over
themselves
by
way
of
coverlet.
"It
was
splendid!"
they
said;
but
it
was
a
little
too
strong
for
me,
and
besides,
I
was
obliged
to
mount
up
on
my
visit
to
Ole.
"It's
moving-day
to
day,"
he
said;
"streets
and
houses
are
like
a
dust-bin—a
large
dust-bin;
but
I'm
content
with
a
cartload.
I
may
get
something
good
out
of
that,
and
I
really
did
get
something
good
out
of
it
once.
Shortly
after
Christmas
I
was
going
up
the
street;
it
was
rough
weather,
wet
and
dirty—the
right
kind
of
weather
to
catch
cold
in.
The
dustman
was
there
with
his
cart,
which
was
full,
and
looked
like
a
sample
of
streets
on
moving-day.
At
the
back
of
the
cart
stood
a
fir
tree,
quite
green
still,
and
with
tinsel
on
its
twigs;
it
had
been
used
on
Christmas
eve,
and
now
it
was
thrown
out
into
the
street,
and
the
dustman
had
stood
it
up
at
the
back
of
his
cart.
It
was
droll
to
look
at,
or
you
may
say
it
was
mournful—all
depends
on
what
you
think
of
when
you
see
it;
and
I
thought
about
it,
and
thought
this
and
that
of
many
things
that
were
in
the
cart:
or
I
might
have
done
so,
and
that
comes
to
the
same
thing.
There
was
an
old
lady's
glove,
too:
I
wonder
what
that
was
thinking
of?
Shall
I
tell
you?
The
glove
was
lying
there,
pointing
with
its
little
finger
at
the
tree.
'I'm
sorry
for
the
tree,'
it
thought;
'and
I
was
also
at
the
feast,
where
the
chandeliers
glittered.
My
life
was,
so
to
speak,
a
ball
night—a
pressure
of
the
hand,
and
I
burst!
My
memory
keeps
dwelling
upon
that,
and
I
have
really
nothing
else
to
live
for!'
This
is
what
the
glove
thought,
or
what
it
might
have
thought.
'That's
a
stupid
affair
with
yonder
fir
tree,'
said
the
potsherds.
You
see,
potsherds
think
everything
is
stupid.
'When
one
is
in
the
dust-cart,'
they
said,
'one
ought
not
to
give
one's
self
airs
and
wear
tinsel.
I
know
that
I
have
been
useful
in
the
world—far
more
useful
than
such
a
green
stick.'
This
was
a
view
that
might
be
taken,
and
I
don't
think
it
quite
a
peculiar
one;
but
for
all
that,
the
fir
tree
looked
very
well:
it
was
like
a
little
poetry
in
the
dust-heap;
and
truly
there
is
dust
enough
in
the
streets
on
moving-day.
The
way
is
difficult
and
troublesome
then,
and
I
feel
obliged
to
run
away
out
of
the
confusion;
or,
if
I
am
on
the
tower,
I
stay
there
and
look
down,
and
it
is
amusing
enough.
"There
are
the
good
people
below,
playing
at
'changing
houses.'
They
toil
and
tug
away
with
their
goods
and
chattels,
and
the
household
goblin
sits
in
an
old
tub
and
moves
with
them.
All
the
little
griefs
of
the
lodging
and
the
family,
and
the
real
cares
and
sorrows,
move
with
them
out
of
the
old
dwelling
into
the
new;
and
what
gain
is
there
for
them
or
for
us
in
the
whole
affair?
Yes,
there
was
written
long
ago
the
good
old
maxim:
'Think
on
the
great
moving-day
of
death!'
That
is
a
serious
thought.
I
hope
it
is
not
disagreeable
to
you
that
I
should
have
touched
upon
it?
Death
is
the
most
certain
messenger,
after
all,
in
spite
of
his
various
occupations.
Yes,
Death
is
the
omnibus
conductor,
and
he
is
the
passport
writer,
and
he
countersigns
our
service-book,
and
he
is
director
of
the
savings
bank
of
life.
Do
you
understand
me?
All
the
deeds
of
our
life,
the
great
and
the
little
alike,
we
put
into
this
savings
bank;
and
when
Death
calls
with
his
omnibus,
and
we
have
to
step
in,
and
drive
with
him
into
the
land
of
eternity,
then
on
the
frontier
he
gives
us
our
service-book
as
a
pass.
As
a
provision
for
the
journey,
he
takes
this
or
that
good
deed
we
have
done,
and
lets
it
accompany
us;
and
this
may
be
very
pleasant
or
very
terrific.
Nobody
has
ever
escaped
the
omnibus
journey.
There
is
certainly
a
talk
about
one
who
was
not
allowed
to
go—they
call
him
the
Wandering
Jew:
he
has
to
ride
behind
the
omnibus.
If
he
had
been
allowed
to
get
in,
he
would
have
escaped
the
clutches
of
the
poets.
"Just
cast
your
mind's
eye
into
that
great
omnibus.
The
society
is
mixed,
for
king
and
beggar,
genius
and
idiot,
sit
side
by
side.
They
must
go
without
their
property
and
money;
they
have
only
the
service-book
and
the
gift
out
of
the
savings
bank
with
them.
But
which
of
our
deeds
is
selected
and
given
to
us?
Perhaps
quite
a
little
one,
one
that
we
have
forgotten,
but
which
has
been
recorded—small
as
a
pea,
but
the
pea
can
send
out
a
blooming
shoot.
The
poor
bumpkin
who
sat
on
a
low
stool
in
the
corner,
and
was
jeered
at
and
flouted,
will
perhaps
have
his
worn-out
stool
given
him
as
a
provision;
and
the
stool
may
become
a
litter
in
the
land
of
eternity,
and
rise
up
then
as
a
throne,
gleaming
like
gold
and
blooming
as
an
arbor.
He
who
always
lounged
about,
and
drank
the
spiced
draught
of
pleasure,
that
he
might
forget
the
wild
things
he
had
done
here,
will
have
his
barrel
given
to
him
on
the
journey,
and
will
have
to
drink
from
it
as
they
go
on;
and
the
drink
is
bright
and
clear,
so
that
the
thoughts
remain
pure,
and
all
good
and
noble
feelings
are
awakened,
and
he
sees
and
feels
what
in
life
he
could
not
or
would
not
see;
and
then
he
has
within
him
the
punishment,
the
gnawing
worm,
which
will
not
die
through
time
incalculable.
If
on
the
glasses
there
stood
written
'oblivion,'
on
the
barrel
'remembrance'
is
inscribed.
"When
I
read
a
good
book,
an
historical
work,
I
always
think
at
last
of
the
poetry
of
what
I
am
reading,
and
of
the
omnibus
of
death,
and
wonder,
which
of
the
hero's
deeds
Death
took
out
of
the
savings
bank
for
him,
and
what
provisions
he
got
on
the
journey
into
eternity.
There
was
once
a
French
king—I
have
forgotten
his
name,
for
the
names
of
good
people
are
sometimes
forgotten,
even
by
me,
but
it
will
come
back
some
day;—there
was
a
king
who,
during
a
famine,
became
the
benefactor
of
his
people;
and
the
people
raised
up
to
his
memory
a
monument
of
snow,
with
the
inscription,
'Quicker
than
this
melts
didst
thou
bring
help!'
I
fancy
that
Death,
looking
back
upon
the
monument,
gave
him
a
single
snow-flake
as
provision,
a
snow-flake
that
never
melts,
and
this
flake
floated
over
his
royal
head,
like
a
white
butterfly,
into
the
land
of
eternity.
Thus,
too,
there
was
Louis
XI.
I
have
remembered
his
name,
for
one
remembers
what
is
bad—a
trait
of
him
often
comes
into
my
thoughts,
and
I
wish
one
could
say
the
story
is
not
true.
He
had
his
lord
high
constable
executed,
and
he
could
execute
him,
right
or
wrong;
but
he
had
the
innocent
children
of
the
constable,
one
seven
and
the
other
eight
years
old,
placed
under
the
scaffold
so
that
the
warm
blood
of
their
father
spurted
over
them,
and
then
he
had
them
sent
to
the
Bastille,
and
shut
up
in
iron
cages,
where
not
even
a
coverlet
was
given
them
to
protect
them
from
the
cold.
And
King
Louis
sent
the
executioner
to
them
every
week,
and
had
a
tooth
pulled
out
of
the
head
of
each,
that
they
might
not
be
too
comfortable;
and
the
elder
of
the
boys
said,
'My
mother
would
die
of
grief
if
she
knew
that
my
younger
brother
had
to
suffer
so
cruelly;
therefore
pull
out
two
of
my
teeth,
and
spare
him.'
The
tears
came
into
the
hangman's
eyes,
but
the
king's
will
was
stronger
than
the
tears;
and
every
week
two
little
teeth
were
brought
to
him
on
a
silver
plate;
he
had
demanded
them,
and
he
had
them.
I
fancy
that
Death
took
these
two
teeth
out
of
the
savings
bank
of
life,
and
gave
them
to
Louis
XI,
to
carry
with
him
on
the
great
journey
into
the
land
of
immortality;
they
fly
before
him
like
two
flames
of
fire;
they
shine
and
burn,
and
they
bite
him,
the
innocent
children's
teeth.
"Yes,
that's
a
serious
journey,
the
omnibus
ride
on
the
great
moving-day!
And
when
is
it
to
be
undertaken?
That's
just
the
serious
part
of
it.
Any
day,
any
hour,
any
minute,
the
omnibus
may
draw
up.
Which
of
our
deeds
will
Death
take
out
of
the
savings
bank,
and
give
to
us
as
provision?
Let
us
think
of
the
moving-day
that
is
not
marked
in
the
calendar."
