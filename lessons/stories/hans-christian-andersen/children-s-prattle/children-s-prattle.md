CHILDREN'S PRATTLE
At
a
rich
merchant's
house
there
was
a
children's
party,
and
the
children
of
rich
and
great
people
were
there.
The
merchant
was
a
learned
man,
for
his
father
had
sent
him
to
college,
and
he
had
passed
his
examination.
His
father
had
been
at
first
only
a
cattle
dealer,
but
always
honest
and
industrious,
so
that
he
had
made
money,
and
his
son,
the
merchant,
had
managed
to
increase
his
store.
Clever
as
he
was,
he
had
also
a
heart;
but
there
was
less
said
of
his
heart
than
of
his
money.
All
descriptions
of
people
visited
at
the
merchant's
house,
well
born,
as
well
as
intellectual,
and
some
who
possessed
neither
of
these
recommendations.
Now
it
was
a
children's
party,
and
there
was
children's
prattle,
which
always
is
spoken
freely
from
the
heart.
Among
them
was
a
beautiful
little
girl,
who
was
terribly
proud;
but
this
had
been
taught
her
by
the
servants,
and
not
by
her
parents,
who
were
far
too
sensible
people.
Her
father
was
groom
of
the
Chambers,
which
is
a
high
office
at
court,
and
she
knew
it.
"I
am
a
child
of
the
court,"
she
said;
now
she
might
just
as
well
have
been
a
child
of
the
cellar,
for
no
one
can
help
his
birth;
and
then
she
told
the
other
children
that
she
was
well-born,
and
said
that
no
one
who
was
not
well-born
could
rise
in
the
world.
It
was
no
use
to
read
and
be
industrious,
for
if
a
person
was
not
well-born,
he
could
never
achieve
anything.
"And
those
whose
names
end
with
'sen,'"
said
she,
"can
never
be
anything
at
all.
We
must
put
our
arms
akimbo,
and
make
the
elbow
quite
pointed,
so
as
to
keep
these
'sen'
people
at
a
great
distance."
And
then
she
stuck
out
her
pretty
little
arms,
and
made
the
elbows
quite
pointed,
to
show
how
it
was
to
be
done;
and
her
little
arms
were
very
pretty,
for
she
was
a
sweet-looking
child.
But
the
little
daughter
of
the
merchant
became
very
angry
at
this
speech,
for
her
father's
name
was
Petersen,
and
she
knew
that
the
name
ended
in
"sen,"
and
therefore
she
said
as
proudly
as
she
could,
"But
my
papa
can
buy
a
hundred
dollars'
worth
of
bonbons,
and
give
them
away
to
children.
Can
your
papa
do
that?"
"Yes;
and
my
papa,"
said
the
little
daughter
of
the
editor
of
a
paper,
"my
papa
can
put
your
papa
and
everybody's
papa
into
the
newspaper.
All
sorts
of
people
are
afraid
of
him,
my
mamma
says,
for
he
can
do
as
he
likes
with
the
paper."
And
the
little
maiden
looked
exceedingly
proud,
as
if
she
had
been
a
real
princess,
who
may
be
expected
to
look
proud.
But
outside
the
door,
which
stood
ajar,
was
a
poor
boy,
peeping
through
the
crack
of
the
door.
He
was
of
such
a
lowly
station
that
he
had
not
been
allowed
even
to
enter
the
room.
He
had
been
turning
the
spit
for
the
cook,
and
she
had
given
him
permission
to
stand
behind
the
door
and
peep
in
at
the
well-dressed
children,
who
were
having
such
a
merry
time
within;
and
for
him
that
was
a
great
deal.
"Oh,
if
I
could
be
one
of
them,"
thought
he,
and
then
he
heard
what
was
said
about
names,
which
was
quite
enough
to
make
him
more
unhappy.
His
parents
at
home
had
not
even
a
penny
to
spare
to
buy
a
newspaper,
much
less
could
they
write
in
one;
and
worse
than
all,
his
father's
name,
and
of
course
his
own,
ended
in
"sen,"
and
therefore
he
could
never
turn
out
well,
which
was
a
very
sad
thought.
But
after
all,
he
had
been
born
into
the
world,
and
the
station
of
life
had
been
chosen
for
him,
therefore
he
must
be
content.
And
this
is
what
happened
on
that
evening.
Many
years
passed,
and
most
of
the
children
became
grown-up
persons.
There
stood
a
splendid
house
in
the
town,
filled
with
all
kinds
of
beautiful
and
valuable
objects.
Everybody
wished
to
see
it,
and
people
even
came
in
from
the
country
round
to
be
permitted
to
view
the
treasures
it
contained.
Which
of
the
children
whose
prattle
we
have
described,
could
call
this
house
his
own?
One
would
suppose
it
very
easy
to
guess.
No,
no;
it
is
not
so
very
easy.
The
house
belonged
to
the
poor
little
boy
who
had
stood
on
that
night
behind
the
door.
He
had
really
become
something
great,
although
his
name
ended
in
"sen,"—for
it
was
Thorwaldsen.
And
the
three
other
children—the
children
of
good
birth,
of
money,
and
of
intellectual
pride,—well,
they
were
respected
and
honored
in
the
world,
for
they
had
been
well
provided
for
by
birth
and
position,
and
they
had
no
cause
to
reproach
themselves
with
what
they
had
thought
and
spoken
on
that
evening
long
ago,
for,
after
all,
it
was
mere
"children's
prattle."
