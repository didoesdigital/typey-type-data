EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE
It
is
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago!
At
the
border
of
the
wood,
near
a
large
lake,
stood
the
old
mansion:
deep
ditches
surrounded
it
on
every
side,
in
which
reeds
and
bulrushes
grew.
Close
by
the
drawbridge,
near
the
gate,
there
was
an
old
willow
tree,
which
bent
over
the
reeds.
From
the
narrow
pass
came
the
sound
of
bugles
and
the
trampling
of
horses'
feet;
therefore
a
little
girl
who
was
watching
the
geese
hastened
to
drive
them
away
from
the
bridge,
before
the
whole
hunting
party
came
galloping
up;
they
came,
however,
so
quickly,
that
the
girl,
in
order
to
avoid
being
run
over,
placed
herself
on
one
of
the
high
corner-stones
of
the
bridge.
She
was
still
half
a
child
and
very
delicately
built;
she
had
bright
blue
eyes,
and
a
gentle,
sweet
expression.
But
such
things
the
baron
did
not
notice;
while
he
was
riding
past
the
little
goose-girl,
he
reversed
his
hunting
crop,
and
in
rough
play
gave
her
such
a
push
with
it
that
she
fell
backward
into
the
ditch.
"Everything
in
the
right
place!"
he
cried.
"Into
the
ditch
with
you."
Then
he
burst
out
laughing,
for
that
he
called
fun;
the
others
joined
in—the
whole
party
shouted
and
cried,
while
the
hounds
barked.
While
the
poor
girl
was
falling
she
happily
caught
one
of
the
branches
of
the
willow
tree,
by
the
help
of
which
she
held
herself
over
the
water,
and
as
soon
as
the
baron
with
his
company
and
the
dogs
had
disappeared
through
the
gate,
the
girl
endeavoured
to
scramble
up,
but
the
branch
broke
off,
and
she
would
have
fallen
backward
among
the
rushes,
had
not
a
strong
hand
from
above
seized
her
at
this
moment.
It
was
the
hand
of
a
pedlar;
he
had
witnessed
what
had
happened
from
a
short
distance,
and
now
hastened
to
assist
her.
"Everything
in
the
right
place,"
he
said,
imitating
the
noble
baron,
and
pulling
the
little
maid
up
to
the
dry
ground.
He
wished
to
put
the
branch
back
in
the
place
it
had
been
broken
off,
but
it
is
not
possible
to
put
everything
in
the
right
place;
therefore
he
stuck
the
branch
into
the
soft
ground.
"Grow
and
thrive
if
you
can,
and
produce
a
good
flute
for
them
yonder
at
the
mansion,"
he
said;
it
would
have
given
him
great
pleasure
to
see
the
noble
baron
and
his
companions
well
thrashed.
Then
he
entered
the
castle—but
not
the
banqueting
hall;
he
was
too
humble
for
that.
No;
he
went
to
the
servants'
hall.
The
men-servants
and
maids
looked
over
his
stock
of
articles
and
bargained
with
him;
loud
crying
and
screaming
were
heard
from
the
master's
table
above:
they
called
it
singing—indeed,
they
did
their
best.
Laughter
and
the
howls
of
dogs
were
heard
through
the
open
windows:
there
they
were
feasting
and
revelling;
wine
and
strong
old
ale
were
foaming
in
the
glasses
and
jugs;
the
favourite
dogs
ate
with
their
masters;
now
and
then
the
squires
kissed
one
of
these
animals,
after
having
wiped
its
mouth
first
with
the
tablecloth.
They
ordered
the
pedlar
to
come
up,
but
only
to
make
fun
of
him.
The
wine
had
got
into
their
heads,
and
reason
had
left
them.
They
poured
beer
into
a
stocking
that
he
could
drink
with
them,
but
quick.
That's
what
they
called
fun,
and
it
made
them
laugh.
Then
meadows,
peasants,
and
farmyards
were
staked
on
one
card
and
lost.
"Everything
in
the
right
place!"
the
pedlar
said
when
he
had
at
last
safely
got
out
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah,
as
he
called
it.
"The
open
high
road
is
my
right
place;
up
there
I
did
not
feel
at
ease."
The
little
maid,
who
was
still
watching
the
geese,
nodded
kindly
to
him
as
he
passed
through
the
gate.
Days
and
weeks
passed,
and
it
was
seen
that
the
broken
willow-branch
which
the
peddlar
had
stuck
into
the
ground
near
the
ditch
remained
fresh
and
green—nay,
it
even
put
forth
fresh
twigs;
the
little
goose-girl
saw
that
the
branch
had
taken
root,
and
was
very
pleased;
the
tree,
so
she
said,
was
now
her
tree.
While
the
tree
was
advancing,
everything
else
at
the
castle
was
going
backward,
through
feasting
and
gambling,
for
these
are
two
rollers
upon
which
nobody
stands
safely.
Less
than
six
years
afterwards
the
baron
passed
out
of
his
castle-gate
a
poor
beggar,
while
the
baronial
seat
had
been
bought
by
a
rich
tradesman.
He
was
the
very
pedlar
they
had
made
fun
of
and
poured
beer
into
a
stocking
for
him
to
drink;
but
honesty
and
industry
bring
one
forward,
and
now
the
pedlar
was
the
possessor
of
the
baronial
estate.
From
that
time
forward
no
card-playing
was
permitted
there.
"That's
a
bad
pastime,"
he
said;
"when
the
devil
saw
the
Bible
for
the
first
time
he
wanted
to
produce
a
caricature
in
opposition
to
it,
and
invented
card-playing."
The
new
proprietor
of
the
estate
took
a
wife,
and
whom
did
he
take?—The
little
goose-girl,
who
had
always
remained
good
and
kind,
and
who
looked
as
beautiful
in
her
new
clothes
as
if
she
had
been
a
lady
of
high
birth.
And
how
did
all
this
come
about?
That
would
be
too
long
a
tale
to
tell
in
our
busy
time,
but
it
really
happened,
and
the
most
important
events
have
yet
to
be
told.
It
was
pleasant
and
cheerful
to
live
in
the
old
place
now:
the
mother
superintended
the
household,
and
the
father
looked
after
things
out-of-doors,
and
they
were
indeed
very
prosperous.
Where
honesty
leads
the
way,
prosperity
is
sure
to
follow.
The
old
mansion
was
repaired
and
painted,
the
ditches
were
cleaned
and
fruit-trees
planted;
all
was
homely
and
pleasant,
and
the
floors
were
as
white
and
shining
as
a
pasteboard.
In
the
long
winter
evenings
the
mistress
and
her
maids
sat
at
the
spinning-wheel
in
the
large
hall;
every
Sunday
the
counsellor—this
title
the
pedlar
had
obtained,
although
only
in
his
old
days—read
aloud
a
portion
from
the
Bible.
The
children
(for
they
had
children)
all
received
the
best
education,
but
they
were
not
all
equally
clever,
as
is
the
case
in
all
families.
In
the
meantime
the
willow
tree
near
the
drawbridge
had
grown
up
into
a
splendid
tree,
and
stood
there,
free,
and
was
never
clipped.
"It
is
our
genealogical
tree,"
said
the
old
people
to
their
children,
"and
therefore
it
must
be
honoured."
A
hundred
years
had
elapsed.
It
was
in
our
own
days;
the
lake
had
been
transformed
into
marsh
land;
the
whole
baronial
seat
had,
as
it
were,
disappeared.
A
pool
of
water
near
some
ruined
walls
was
the
only
remainder
of
the
deep
ditches;
and
here
stood
a
magnificent
old
tree
with
overhanging
branches—that
was
the
genealogical
tree.
Here
it
stood,
and
showed
how
beautiful
a
willow
can
look
if
one
does
not
interfere
with
it.
The
trunk,
it
is
true,
was
cleft
in
the
middle
from
the
root
to
the
crown;
the
storms
had
bent
it
a
little,
but
it
still
stood
there,
and
out
of
every
crevice
and
cleft,
in
which
wind
and
weather
had
carried
mould,
blades
of
grass
and
flowers
sprang
forth.
Especially
above,
where
the
large
boughs
parted,
there
was
quite
a
hanging
garden,
in
which
wild
raspberries
and
hart's-tongue
ferns
throve,
and
even
a
little
mistletoe
had
taken
root,
and
grew
gracefully
in
the
old
willow
branches,
which
were
reflected
in
the
dark
water
beneath
when
the
wind
blew
the
chickweed
into
the
corner
of
the
pool.
A
footpath
which
led
across
the
fields
passed
close
by
the
old
tree.
High
up,
on
the
woody
hillside,
stood
the
new
mansion.
It
had
a
splendid
view,
and
was
large
and
magnificent;
its
window
panes
were
so
clear
that
one
might
have
thought
there
were
none
there
at
all.
The
large
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
entrance
looked
like
a
bower
covered
with
roses
and
broad-leaved
plants.
The
lawn
was
as
green
as
if
each
blade
of
grass
was
cleaned
separately
morning
and
evening.
Inside,
in
the
hall,
valuable
oil
paintings
were
hanging
on
the
walls.
Here
stood
chairs
and
sofas
covered
with
silk
and
velvet,
which
could
be
easily
rolled
about
on
castors;
there
were
tables
with
polished
marble
tops,
and
books
bound
in
morocco
with
gilt
edges.
Indeed,
well-to-do
and
distinguished
people
lived
here;
it
was
the
dwelling
of
the
baron
and
his
family.
Each
article
was
in
keeping
with
its
surroundings.
"Everything
in
the
right
place"
was
the
motto
according
to
which
they
also
acted
here,
and
therefore
all
the
paintings
which
had
once
been
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
old
mansion
were
now
hung
up
in
the
passage
which
led
to
the
servants'
rooms.
It
was
all
old
lumber,
especially
two
portraits—one
representing
a
man
in
a
scarlet
coat
with
a
wig,
and
the
other
a
lady
with
powdered
and
curled
hair
holding
a
rose
in
her
hand,
each
of
them
being
surrounded
by
a
large
wreath
of
willow
branches.
Both
portraits
had
many
holes
in
them,
because
the
baron's
sons
used
the
two
old
people
as
targets
for
their
crossbows.
They
represented
the
counsellor
and
his
wife,
from
whom
the
whole
family
descended.
"But
they
did
not
properly
belong
to
our
family,"
said
one
of
the
boys;
"he
was
a
pedlar
and
she
kept
the
geese.
They
were
not
like
papa
and
mamma."
The
portraits
were
old
lumber,
and
"everything
in
its
right
place."
That
was
why
the
great-grandparents
had
been
hung
up
in
the
passage
leading
to
the
servants'
rooms.
The
son
of
the
village
pastor
was
tutor
at
the
mansion.
One
day
he
went
for
a
walk
across
the
fields
with
his
young
pupils
and
their
elder
sister,
who
had
lately
been
confirmed.
They
walked
along
the
road
which
passed
by
the
old
willow
tree,
and
while
they
were
on
the
road
she
picked
a
bunch
of
field-flowers.
"Everything
in
the
right
place,"
and
indeed
the
bunch
looked
very
beautiful.
At
the
same
time
she
listened
to
all
that
was
said,
and
she
very
much
liked
to
hear
the
pastor's
son
speak
about
the
elements
and
of
the
great
men
and
women
in
history.
She
had
a
healthy
mind,
noble
in
thought
and
deed,
and
with
a
heart
full
of
love
for
everything
that
God
had
created.
They
stopped
at
the
old
willow
tree,
as
the
youngest
of
the
baron's
sons
wished
very
much
to
have
a
flute
from
it,
such
as
had
been
cut
for
him
from
other
willow
trees;
the
pastor's
son
broke
a
branch
off.
"Oh,
pray
do
not
do
it!"
said
the
young
lady;
but
it
was
already
done.
"That
is
our
famous
old
tree.
I
love
it
very
much.
They
often
laugh
at
me
at
home
about
it,
but
that
does
not
matter.
There
is
a
story
attached
to
this
tree."
And
now
she
told
him
all
that
we
already
know
about
the
tree—the
old
mansion,
the
pedlar
and
the
goose-girl
who
had
met
there
for
the
first
time,
and
had
become
the
ancestors
of
the
noble
family
to
which
the
young
lady
belonged.
"They
did
not
like
to
be
knighted,
the
good
old
people,"
she
said;
"their
motto
was
'everything
in
the
right
place,'
and
it
would
not
be
right,
they
thought,
to
purchase
a
title
for
money.
My
grandfather,
the
first
baron,
was
their
son.
They
say
he
was
a
very
learned
man,
a
great
favourite
with
the
princes
and
princesses,
and
was
invited
to
all
court
festivities.
The
others
at
home
love
him
best;
but,
I
do
not
know
why,
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
about
the
old
couple
that
attracts
my
heart!
How
homely,
how
patriarchal,
it
must
have
been
in
the
old
mansion,
where
the
mistress
sat
at
the
spinning-wheel
with
her
maids,
while
her
husband
read
aloud
out
of
the
Bible!"
"They
must
have
been
excellent,
sensible
people,"
said
the
pastor's
son.
And
with
this
the
conversation
turned
naturally
to
noblemen
and
commoners;
from
the
manner
in
which
the
tutor
spoke
about
the
significance
of
being
noble,
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
did
not
belong
to
a
commoner's
family.
"It
is
good
fortune
to
be
of
a
family
who
have
distinguished
themselves,
and
to
possess
as
it
were
a
spur
in
oneself
to
advance
to
all
that
is
good.
It
is
a
splendid
thing
to
belong
to
a
noble
family,
whose
name
serves
as
a
card
of
admission
to
the
highest
circles.
Nobility
is
a
distinction;
it
is
a
gold
coin
that
bears
the
stamp
of
its
own
value.
It
is
the
fallacy
of
the
time,
and
many
poets
express
it,
to
say
that
all
that
is
noble
is
bad
and
stupid,
and
that,
on
the
contrary,
the
lower
one
goes
among
the
poor,
the
more
brilliant
virtues
one
finds.
I
do
not
share
this
opinion,
for
it
is
wrong.
In
the
upper
classes
one
sees
many
touchingly
beautiful
traits;
my
own
mother
has
told
me
of
such,
and
I
could
mention
several.
One
day
she
was
visiting
a
nobleman's
house
in
town;
my
grandmother,
I
believe,
had
been
the
lady's
nurse
when
she
was
a
child.
My
mother
and
the
nobleman
were
alone
in
the
room,
when
he
suddenly
noticed
an
old
woman
on
crutches
come
limping
into
the
courtyard;
she
came
every
Sunday
to
carry
a
gift
away
with
her.
"'There
is
the
poor
old
woman,'
said
the
nobleman;
'it
is
so
difficult
for
her
to
walk.'
"My
mother
had
hardly
understood
what
he
said
before
he
disappeared
from
the
room,
and
went
downstairs,
in
order
to
save
her
the
troublesome
walk
for
the
gift
she
came
to
fetch.
Of
course
this
is
only
a
little
incident,
but
it
has
its
good
sound
like
the
poor
widow's
two
mites
in
the
Bible,
the
sound
which
echoes
in
the
depth
of
every
human
heart;
and
this
is
what
the
poet
ought
to
show
and
point
out—more
especially
in
our
own
time
he
ought
to
sing
of
this;
it
does
good,
it
mitigates
and
reconciles!
But
when
a
man,
simply
because
he
is
of
noble
birth
and
possesses
a
genealogy,
stands
on
his
hind
legs
and
neighs
in
the
street
like
an
Arabian
horse,
and
says
when
a
commoner
has
been
in
a
room:
'Some
people
from
the
street
have
been
here,'
there
nobility
is
decaying;
it
has
become
a
mask
of
the
kind
that
Thespis
created,
and
it
is
amusing
when
such
a
person
is
exposed
in
satire."
Such
was
the
tutor's
speech;
it
was
a
little
long,
but
while
he
delivered
it
he
had
finished
cutting
the
flute.
There
was
a
large
party
at
the
mansion;
many
guests
from
the
neighbourhood
and
from
the
capital
had
arrived.
There
were
ladies
with
tasteful
and
with
tasteless
dresses;
the
big
hall
was
quite
crowded
with
people.
The
clergymen
stood
humbly
together
in
a
corner,
and
looked
as
if
they
were
preparing
for
a
funeral,
but
it
was
a
festival—only
the
amusement
had
not
yet
begun.
A
great
concert
was
to
take
place,
and
that
is
why
the
baron's
young
son
had
brought
his
willow
flute
with
him;
but
he
could
not
make
it
sound,
nor
could
his
father,
and
therefore
the
flute
was
good
for
nothing.
There
was
music
and
songs
of
the
kind
which
delight
most
those
that
perform
them;
otherwise
quite
charming!
"Are
you
an
artist?"
said
a
cavalier,
the
son
of
his
father;
"you
play
on
the
flute,
you
have
made
it
yourself;
it
is
genius
that
rules—the
place
of
honour
is
due
to
you."
"Certainly
not!
I
only
advance
with
the
time,
and
that
of
course
one
can't
help."
"I
hope
you
will
delight
us
all
with
the
little
instrument—will
you
not?"
Thus
saying
he
handed
to
the
tutor
the
flute
which
had
been
cut
from
the
willow
tree
by
the
pool;
and
then
announced
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
tutor
wished
to
perform
a
solo
on
the
flute.
They
wished
to
tease
him—that
was
evident,
and
therefore
the
tutor
declined
to
play,
although
he
could
do
so
very
well.
They
urged
and
requested
him,
however,
so
long,
that
at
last
he
took
up
the
flute
and
placed
it
to
his
lips.
That
was
a
marvellous
flute!
Its
sound
was
as
thrilling
as
the
whistle
of
a
steam
engine;
in
fact
it
was
much
stronger,
for
it
sounded
and
was
heard
in
the
yard,
in
the
garden,
in
the
wood,
and
many
miles
round
in
the
country;
at
the
same
time
a
storm
rose
and
roared;
"Everything
in
the
right
place."
And
with
this
the
baron,
as
if
carried
by
the
wind,
flew
out
of
the
hall
straight
into
the
shepherd's
cottage,
and
the
shepherd
flew—not
into
the
hall,
thither
he
could
not
come—but
into
the
servants'
hall,
among
the
smart
footmen
who
were
striding
about
in
silk
stockings;
these
haughty
menials
looked
horror-struck
that
such
a
person
ventured
to
sit
at
table
with
them.
But
in
the
hall
the
baron's
daughter
flew
to
the
place
of
honour
at
the
end
of
the
table—she
was
worthy
to
sit
there;
the
pastor's
son
had
the
seat
next
to
her;
the
two
sat
there
as
if
they
were
a
bridal
pair.
An
old
Count,
belonging
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
of
the
country,
remained
untouched
in
his
place
of
honour;
the
flute
was
just,
and
it
is
one's
duty
to
be
so.
The
sharp-tongued
cavalier
who
had
caused
the
flute
to
be
played,
and
who
was
the
child
of
his
parents,
flew
headlong
into
the
fowl-house,
but
not
he
alone.
The
flute
was
heard
at
the
distance
of
a
mile,
and
strange
events
took
place.
A
rich
banker's
family,
who
were
driving
in
a
coach
and
four,
were
blown
out
of
it,
and
could
not
even
find
room
behind
it
with
their
footmen.
Two
rich
farmers
who
had
in
our
days
shot
up
higher
than
their
own
corn-fields,
were
flung
into
the
ditch;
it
was
a
dangerous
flute.
Fortunately
it
burst
at
the
first
sound,
and
that
was
a
good
thing,
for
then
it
was
put
back
into
its
owner's
pocket—"its
right
place."
The
next
day,
nobody
spoke
a
word
about
what
had
taken
place;
thus
originated
the
phrase,
"to
pocket
the
flute."
Everything
was
again
in
its
usual
order,
except
that
the
two
old
pictures
of
the
peddlar
and
the
goose-girl
were
hanging
in
the
banqueting-hall.
There
they
were
on
the
wall
as
if
blown
up
there;
and
as
a
real
expert
said
that
they
were
painted
by
a
master's
hand,
they
remained
there
and
were
restored.
"Everything
in
the
right
place,"
and
to
this
it
will
come.
Eternity
is
long,
much
longer
indeed
than
this
story.
