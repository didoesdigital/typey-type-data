THE JEWISH MAIDEN
In
a
charity
school,
among
the
children,
sat
a
little
Jewish
girl.
She
was
a
good,
intelligent
child,
and
very
quick
at
her
lessons;
but
the
Scripture-lesson
class
she
was
not
allowed
to
join,
for
this
was
a
Christian
school.
During
the
hour
of
this
lesson,
the
Jewish
girl
was
allowed
to
learn
her
geography,
or
to
work
her
sum
for
the
next
day;
and
when
her
geography
lesson
was
perfect,
the
book
remained
open
before
her,
but
she
read
not
another
word,
for
she
sat
silently
listening
to
the
words
of
the
Christian
teacher.
He
soon
became
aware
that
the
little
one
was
paying
more
attention
to
what
he
said
than
most
of
the
other
children.
"Read
your
book,
Sarah,"
he
said
to
her
gently.
But
again
and
again
he
saw
her
dark,
beaming
eyes
fixed
upon
him;
and
once,
when
he
asked
her
a
question,
she
could
answer
him
even
better
than
the
other
children.
She
had
not
only
heard,
but
understood
his
words,
and
pondered
them
in
her
heart.
Her
father,
a
poor
but
honest
man,
had
placed
his
daughter
at
the
school
on
the
conditions
that
she
should
not
be
instructed
in
the
Christian
faith.
But
it
might
have
caused
confusion,
or
raised
discontent
in
the
minds
of
the
other
children
if
she
had
been
sent
out
of
the
room,
so
she
remained;
and
now
it
was
evident
this
could
not
go
on.
The
teacher
went
to
her
father,
and
advised
him
to
remove
his
daughter
from
the
school,
or
to
allow
her
to
become
a
Christian.
"I
cannot
any
longer
be
an
idle
spectator
of
those
beaming
eyes,
which
express
such
a
deep
and
earnest
longing
for
the
words
of
the
gospel,"
said
he.
Then
the
father
burst
into
tears.
"I
know
very
little
of
the
law
of
my
fathers,"
said
he;
"but
Sarah's
mother
was
firm
in
her
belief
as
a
daughter
of
Israel,
and
I
vowed
to
her
on
her
deathbed
that
our
child
should
never
be
baptized.
I
must
keep
my
vow:
it
is
to
me
even
as
a
covenant
with
God
Himself."
And
so
the
little
Jewish
girl
left
the
Christian
school.
Years
rolled
by.
In
one
of
the
smallest
provincial
towns,
in
a
humble
household,
lived
a
poor
maiden
of
the
Jewish
faith,
as
a
servant.
Her
hair
was
black
as
ebony,
her
eye
dark
as
night,
yet
full
of
light
and
brilliancy
so
peculiar
to
the
daughters
of
the
east.
It
was
Sarah.
The
expression
in
the
face
of
the
grown-up
maiden
was
still
the
same
as
when,
a
child,
she
sat
on
the
schoolroom
form
listening
with
thoughtful
eyes
to
the
words
of
the
Christian
teacher.
Every
Sunday
there
sounded
forth
from
a
church
close
by
the
tones
of
an
organ
and
the
singing
of
the
congregation.
The
Jewish
girl
heard
them
in
the
house
where,
industrious
and
faithful
in
all
things,
she
performed
her
household
duties.
"Thou
shalt
keep
the
Sabbath
holy,"
said
the
voice
of
the
law
in
her
heart;
but
her
Sabbath
was
a
working
day
among
the
Christians,
which
was
a
great
trouble
to
her.
And
then
as
the
thought
arose
in
her
mind,
"Does
God
reckon
by
days
and
hours?"
her
conscience
felt
satisfied
on
this
question,
and
she
found
it
a
comfort
to
her,
that
on
the
Christian
Sabbath
she
could
have
an
hour
for
her
own
prayers
undisturbed.
The
music
and
singing
of
the
congregation
sounded
in
her
ears
while
at
work
in
her
kitchen,
till
the
place
itself
became
sacred
to
her.
Then
she
would
read
in
the
Old
Testament,
that
treasure
and
comfort
to
her
people,
and
it
was
indeed
the
only
Scriptures
she
could
read.
Faithfully
in
her
inmost
thoughts
had
she
kept
the
words
of
her
father
to
her
teacher
when
she
left
the
school,
and
the
vow
he
had
made
to
her
dying
mother
that
she
should
never
receive
Christian
baptism.
The
New
Testament
must
remain
to
her
a
sealed
book,
and
yet
she
knew
a
great
deal
of
its
teaching,
and
the
sound
of
the
gospel
truths
still
lingered
among
the
recollections
of
her
childhood.
One
evening
she
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
dining-room,
while
her
master
read
aloud.
It
was
not
the
gospel
he
read,
but
an
old
story-book;
therefore
she
might
stay
and
listen
to
him.
The
story
related
that
a
Hungarian
knight,
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
a
Turkish
pasha,
was
most
cruelly
treated
by
him.
He
caused
him
to
be
yoked
with
his
oxen
to
the
plough,
and
driven
with
blows
from
the
whip
till
the
blood
flowed,
and
he
almost
sunk
with
exhaustion
and
pain.
The
faithful
wife
of
the
knight
at
home
gave
up
all
her
jewels,
mortgaged
her
castle
and
land,
and
his
friends
raised
large
sums
to
make
up
the
ransom
demanded
for
his
release,
which
was
most
enormously
high.
It
was
collected
at
last,
and
the
knight
released
from
slavery
and
misery.
Sick
and
exhausted,
he
reached
home.
Ere
long
came
another
summons
to
a
struggle
with
the
foes
of
Christianity.
The
still
living
knight
heard
the
sound;
he
could
endure
no
more,
he
had
neither
peace
nor
rest.
He
caused
himself
to
be
lifted
on
his
war-horse;
the
color
came
into
his
cheeks,
and
his
strength
returned
to
him
again
as
he
went
forth
to
battle
and
to
victory.
The
very
same
pasha
who
had
yoked
him
to
the
plough,
became
his
prisoner,
and
was
dragged
to
a
dungeon
in
the
castle.
But
an
hour
had
scarcely
passed,
when
the
knight
stood
before
the
captive
pasha,
and
inquired,
"What
do
you
suppose
awaiteth
thee?"
"I
know,"
replied
the
pasha;
"retribution."
"Yes,
the
retribution
of
a
Christian,"
replied
the
knight.
"The
teaching
of
Christ,
the
Teacher,
commands
us
to
forgive
our
enemies,
to
love
our
neighbors;
for
God
is
love.
Depart
in
peace:
return
to
thy
home.
I
give
thee
back
to
thy
loved
ones.
But
in
future
be
mild
and
humane
to
all
who
are
in
trouble."
Then
the
prisoner
burst
into
tears,
and
exclaimed,
"Oh
how
could
I
imagine
such
mercy
and
forgiveness!
I
expected
pain
and
torment.
It
seemed
to
me
so
sure
that
I
took
poison,
which
I
secretly
carried
about
me;
and
in
a
few
hours
its
effects
will
destroy
me.
I
must
die!
Nothing
can
save
me!
But
before
I
die,
explain
to
me
the
teaching
which
is
so
full
of
love
and
mercy,
so
great
and
God-like.
Oh,
that
I
may
hear
his
teaching,
and
die
a
Christian!"
And
his
prayer
was
granted.
This
was
the
legend
which
the
master
read
out
of
the
old
story-book.
Every
one
in
the
house
who
was
present
listened,
and
shared
the
pleasure;
but
Sarah,
the
Jewish
girl,
sitting
so
still
in
a
corner,
felt
her
heart
burn
with
excitement.
Great
tears
came
into
her
shining
dark
eyes;
and
with
the
same
gentle
piety
with
which
she
had
once
listened
to
the
gospel
while
sitting
on
the
form
at
school,
she
felt
its
grandeur
now,
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks.
Then
the
last
words
of
her
dying
mother
rose
before
her,
"Let
not
my
child
become
a
Christian;"
and
with
them
sounded
in
her
heart
the
words
of
the
law,
"Honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother."
"I
am
not
admitted
among
the
Christians,"
she
said;
"they
mock
me
as
a
Jewish
girl;
the
neighbors'
boys
did
so
last
Sunday
when
I
stood
looking
in
through
the
open
church
door
at
the
candles
burning
on
the
altar,
and
listening
to
the
singing.
Ever
since
I
sat
on
the
school-bench
I
have
felt
the
power
of
Christianity;
a
power
which,
like
a
sunbeam,
streams
into
my
heart,
however
closely
I
may
close
my
eyes
against
it.
But
I
will
not
grieve
thee,
my
mother,
in
thy
grave.
I
will
not
be
unfaithful
to
my
father's
vow.
I
will
not
read
the
Bible
of
the
Christian.
I
have
the
God
of
my
fathers,
and
in
Him
I
will
trust."
And
again
years
passed
by.
Sarah's
master
died,
and
his
widow
found
herself
in
such
reduced
circumstances
that
she
wished
to
dismiss
her
servant
maid;
but
Sarah
refused
to
leave
the
house,
and
she
became
a
true
support
in
time
of
trouble,
and
kept
the
household
together
by
working
till
late
at
night,
with
her
busy
hands,
to
earn
their
daily
bread.
Not
a
relative
came
forward
to
assist
them,
and
the
widow
was
confined
to
a
sick
bed
for
months
and
grew
weaker
from
day
to
day.
Sarah
worked
hard,
but
contrived
to
spare
time
to
amuse
her
and
watch
by
the
sick
bed.
She
was
gentle
and
pious,
an
angel
of
blessing
in
that
house
of
poverty.
"My
Bible
lies
on
the
table
yonder,"
said
the
sick
woman
one
day
to
Sarah.
"Read
me
something
from
it;
the
night
appears
so
long,
and
my
spirit
thirsts
to
hear
the
word
of
God."
And
Sarah
bowed
her
head.
She
took
the
book,
and
folded
her
hand
over
the
Bible
of
the
Christians,
and
at
last
opened
it,
and
read
to
the
sick
woman.
Tears
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
read,
and
they
shone
with
brightness,
for
in
her
heart
it
was
light.
"Mother,"
she
murmured,
"thy
child
may
not
receive
Christian
baptism,
nor
be
admitted
into
the
congregation
of
Christian
people.
Thou
hast
so
willed
it,
and
I
will
respect
thy
command.
We
are
therefore
still
united
here
on
earth;
but
in
the
next
world
there
will
be
a
higher
union,
even
with
God
Himself,
who
leads
and
guides
His
people
till
death.
He
came
down
from
heaven
to
earth
to
suffer
for
us,
that
we
should
bring
forth
the
fruits
of
repentance.
I
understand
it
now.
I
know
not
how
I
learnt
this
truth,
unless
it
is
through
the
name
of
Christ."
Yet
she
trembled
as
she
pronounced
the
holy
name.
She
struggled
against
these
convictions
of
the
truth
of
Christianity
for
some
days,
till
one
evening
while
watching
her
mistress
she
was
suddenly
taken
very
ill;
her
limbs
tottered
under
her,
and
she
sank
fainting
by
the
bedside
of
the
sick
woman.
"Poor
Sarah,"
said
the
neighbors;
"she
is
overcome
with
hard
work
and
night
watching."
And
then
they
carried
her
to
the
hospital
for
the
sick
poor.
There
she
died;
and
they
bore
her
to
her
resting-place
in
the
earth,
but
not
to
the
churchyard
of
the
Christians.
There
was
no
place
for
the
Jewish
girl;
but
they
dug
a
grave
for
her
outside
the
wall.
And
God's
sun,
which
shines
upon
the
graves
of
the
churchyard
of
the
Christians,
also
throws
its
beams
on
the
grave
of
the
Jewish
maiden
beyond
the
wall.
And
when
the
psalms
of
the
Christians
sound
across
the
churchyard,
their
echo
reaches
her
lonely
resting-place;
and
she
who
sleeps
there
will
be
counted
worthy
at
the
resurrection,
through
the
name
of
Christ
the
Lord,
who
said
to
His
disciples,
"John
baptized
you
with
water,
but
I
will
baptize
you
with
the
Holy
Ghost."
