THE PEN AND THE INKSTAND
In
a
poet's
room,
where
his
inkstand
stood
on
the
table,
the
remark
was
once
made,
"It
is
wonderful
what
can
be
brought
out
of
an
inkstand.
What
will
come
next?
It
is
indeed
wonderful."
"Yes,
certainly,"
said
the
inkstand
to
the
pen,
and
to
the
other
articles
that
stood
on
the
table;
"that's
what
I
always
say.
It
is
wonderful
and
extraordinary
what
a
number
of
things
come
out
of
me.
It's
quite
incredible,
and
I
really
don't
know
what
is
coming
next
when
that
man
dips
his
pen
into
me.
One
drop
out
of
me
is
enough
for
half
a
page
of
paper,
and
what
cannot
half
a
page
contain?
From
me,
all
the
works
of
a
poet
are
produced;
all
those
imaginary
characters
whom
people
fancy
they
have
known
or
met.
All
the
deep
feeling,
the
humor,
and
the
vivid
pictures
of
nature.
I
myself
don't
understand
how
it
is,
for
I
am
not
acquainted
with
nature,
but
it
is
certainly
in
me.
From
me
have
gone
forth
to
the
world
those
wonderful
descriptions
of
troops
of
charming
maidens,
and
of
brave
knights
on
prancing
steeds;
of
the
halt
and
the
blind,
and
I
know
not
what
more,
for
I
assure
you
I
never
think
of
these
things."
"There
you
are
right,"
said
the
pen,
"for
you
don't
think
at
all;
if
you
did,
you
would
see
that
you
can
only
provide
the
means.
You
give
the
fluid
that
I
may
place
upon
the
paper
what
dwells
in
me,
and
what
I
wish
to
bring
to
light.
It
is
the
pen
that
writes:
no
man
doubts
that;
and,
indeed,
most
people
understand
as
much
about
poetry
as
an
old
inkstand."
"You
have
had
very
little
experience,"
replied
the
inkstand.
"You
have
hardly
been
in
service
a
week,
and
are
already
half
worn
out.
Do
you
imagine
you
are
a
poet?
You
are
only
a
servant,
and
before
you
came
I
had
many
like
you,
some
of
the
goose
family,
and
others
of
English
manufacture.
I
know
a
quill
pen
as
well
as
I
know
a
steel
one.
I
have
had
both
sorts
in
my
service,
and
I
shall
have
many
more
when
he
comes—the
man
who
performs
the
mechanical
part—and
writes
down
what
he
obtains
from
me.
I
should
like
to
know
what
will
be
the
next
thing
he
gets
out
of
me."
"Inkpot!"
exclaimed
the
pen
contemptuously.
Late
in
the
evening
the
poet
came
home.
He
had
been
to
a
concert,
and
had
been
quite
enchanted
with
the
admirable
performance
of
a
famous
violin
player
whom
he
had
heard
there.
The
performer
had
produced
from
his
instrument
a
richness
of
tone
that
sometimes
sounded
like
tinkling
waterdrops
or
rolling
pearls;
sometimes
like
the
birds
twittering
in
chorus,
and
then
rising
and
swelling
in
sound
like
the
wind
through
the
fir-trees.
The
poet
felt
as
if
his
own
heart
were
weeping,
but
in
tones
of
melody
like
the
sound
of
a
woman's
voice.
It
seemed
not
only
the
strings,
but
every
part
of
the
instrument
from
which
these
sounds
were
produced.
It
was
a
wonderful
performance
and
a
difficult
piece,
and
yet
the
bow
seemed
to
glide
across
the
strings
so
easily
that
it
was
as
if
any
one
could
do
it
who
tried.
Even
the
violin
and
the
bow
appeared
to
perform
independently
of
their
master
who
guided
them;
it
was
as
if
soul
and
spirit
had
been
breathed
into
the
instrument,
so
the
audience
forgot
the
performer
in
the
beautiful
sounds
he
produced.
Not
so
the
poet;
he
remembered
him,
and
named
him,
and
wrote
down
his
thoughts
on
the
subject.
"How
foolish
it
would
be
for
the
violin
and
the
bow
to
boast
of
their
performance,
and
yet
we
men
often
commit
that
folly.
The
poet,
the
artist,
the
man
of
science
in
his
laboratory,
the
general,—we
all
do
it;
and
yet
we
are
only
the
instruments
which
the
Almighty
uses;
to
Him
alone
the
honor
is
due.
We
have
nothing
of
ourselves
of
which
we
should
be
proud."
Yes,
this
is
what
the
poet
wrote
down.
He
wrote
it
in
the
form
of
a
parable,
and
called
it
"The
Master
and
the
Instruments."
"That
is
what
you
have
got,
madam,"
said
the
pen
to
the
inkstand,
when
the
two
were
alone
again.
"Did
you
hear
him
read
aloud
what
I
had
written
down?"
"Yes,
what
I
gave
you
to
write,"
retorted
the
inkstand.
"That
was
a
cut
at
you
because
of
your
conceit.
To
think
that
you
could
not
understand
that
you
were
being
quizzed.
I
gave
you
a
cut
from
within
me.
Surely
I
must
know
my
own
satire."
"Ink-pitcher!"
cried
the
pen.
"Writing-stick!"
retorted
the
inkstand.
And
each
of
them
felt
satisfied
that
he
had
given
a
good
answer.
It
is
pleasing
to
be
convinced
that
you
have
settled
a
matter
by
your
reply;
it
is
something
to
make
you
sleep
well,
and
they
both
slept
well
upon
it.
But
the
poet
did
not
sleep.
Thoughts
rose
up
within
him
like
the
tones
of
the
violin,
falling
like
pearls,
or
rushing
like
the
strong
wind
through
the
forest.
He
understood
his
own
heart
in
these
thoughts;
they
were
as
a
ray
from
the
mind
of
the
Great
Master
of
all
minds.
"To
Him
be
all
the
honor."
