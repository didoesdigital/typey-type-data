THE THORNY ROAD OF HONOR
An
old
story
yet
lives
of
the
"Thorny
Road
of
Honor,"
of
a
marksman,
who
indeed
attained
to
rank
and
office,
but
only
after
a
lifelong
and
weary
strife
against
difficulties.
Who
has
not,
in
reading
this
story,
thought
of
his
own
strife,
and
of
his
own
numerous
"difficulties?"
The
story
is
very
closely
akin
to
reality;
but
still
it
has
its
harmonious
explanation
here
on
earth,
while
reality
often
points
beyond
the
confines
of
life
to
the
regions
of
eternity.
The
history
of
the
world
is
like
a
magic
lantern
that
displays
to
us,
in
light
pictures
upon
the
dark
ground
of
the
present,
how
the
benefactors
of
mankind,
the
martyrs
of
genius,
wandered
along
the
thorny
road
of
honor.
From
all
periods,
and
from
every
country,
these
shining
pictures
display
themselves
to
us.
Each
only
appears
for
a
few
moments,
but
each
represents
a
whole
life,
sometimes
a
whole
age,
with
its
conflicts
and
victories.
Let
us
contemplate
here
and
there
one
of
the
company
of
martyrs—the
company
which
will
receive
new
members
until
the
world
itself
shall
pass
away.
We
look
down
upon
a
crowded
amphitheatre.
Out
of
the
"Clouds"
of
Aristophanes,
satire
and
humor
are
pouring
down
in
streams
upon
the
audience;
on
the
stage
Socrates,
the
most
remarkable
man
in
Athens,
he
who
had
been
the
shield
and
defence
of
the
people
against
the
thirty
tyrants,
is
held
up
mentally
and
bodily
to
ridicule—Socrates,
who
saved
Alcibiades
and
Xenophon
in
the
turmoil
of
battle,
and
whose
genius
soared
far
above
the
gods
of
the
ancients.
He
himself
is
present;
he
has
risen
from
the
spectator's
bench,
and
has
stepped
forward,
that
the
laughing
Athenians
may
well
appreciate
the
likeness
between
himself
and
the
caricature
on
the
stage.
There
he
stands
before
them,
towering
high
above
them
all.
Thou
juicy,
green,
poisonous
hemlock,
throw
thy
shadow
over
Athens—not
thou,
olive
tree
of
fame!
Seven
cities
contended
for
the
honor
of
giving
birth
to
Homer—that
is
to
say,
they
contended
after
his
death!
Let
us
look
at
him
as
he
was
in
his
lifetime.
He
wanders
on
foot
through
the
cities,
and
recites
his
verses
for
a
livelihood;
the
thought
for
the
morrow
turns
his
hair
gray!
He,
the
great
seer,
is
blind,
and
painfully
pursues
his
way—the
sharp
thorn
tears
the
mantle
of
the
king
of
poets.
His
song
yet
lives,
and
through
that
alone
live
all
the
heroes
and
gods
of
antiquity.
One
picture
after
another
springs
up
from
the
east,
from
the
west,
far
removed
from
each
other
in
time
and
place,
and
yet
each
one
forming
a
portion
of
the
thorny
road
of
honor,
on
which
the
thistle
indeed
displays
a
flower,
but
only
to
adorn
the
grave.
The
camels
pass
along
under
the
palm
trees;
they
are
richly
laden
with
indigo
and
other
treasures
of
value,
sent
by
the
ruler
of
the
land
to
him
whose
songs
are
the
delight
of
the
people,
the
fame
of
the
country.
He
whom
envy
and
falsehood
have
driven
into
exile
has
been
found,
and
the
caravan
approaches
the
little
town
in
which
he
has
taken
refuge.
A
poor
corpse
is
carried
out
of
the
town
gate,
and
the
funeral
procession
causes
the
caravan
to
halt.
The
dead
man
is
he
whom
they
have
been
sent
to
seek—Firdusi—who
has
wandered
the
Thorny
road
of
honor
even
to
the
end.
The
African,
with
blunt
features,
thick
lips,
and
woolly
hair,
sits
on
the
marble
steps
of
the
palace
in
the
capital
of
Portugal,
and
begs.
He
is
the
submissive
slave
of
Camoens,
and
but
for
him,
and
for
the
copper
coins
thrown
to
him
by
the
passers-by,
his
master,
the
poet
of
the
"Lusiad,"
would
die
of
hunger.
Now,
a
costly
monument
marks
the
grave
of
Camoens.
There
is
a
new
picture.
Behind
the
iron
grating
a
man
appears,
pale
as
death,
with
long
unkempt
beard.
"I
have
made
a
discovery,"
he
says,
"the
greatest
that
has
been
made
for
centuries;
and
they
have
kept
me
locked
up
here
for
more
than
twenty
years!"
Who
is
the
man?
"A
madman,"
replies
the
keeper
of
the
madhouse.
"What
whimsical
ideas
these
lunatics
have!
He
imagines
that
one
can
propel
things
by
means
of
steam."
It
is
Solomon
de
Cares,
the
discoverer
of
the
power
of
steam,
whose
theory,
expressed
in
dark
words,
is
not
understood
by
Richelieu;
and
he
dies
in
the
madhouse.
Here
stands
Columbus,
whom
the
street
boys
used
once
to
follow
and
jeer,
because
he
wanted
to
discover
a
new
world;
and
he
has
discovered
it.
Shouts
of
joy
greet
him
from
the
breasts
of
all,
and
the
clash
of
bells
sounds
to
celebrate
his
triumphant
return;
but
the
clash
of
the
bells
of
envy
soon
drowns
the
others.
The
discoverer
of
a
world—he
who
lifted
the
American
gold
land
from
the
sea,
and
gave
it
to
his
king—he
is
rewarded
with
iron
chains.
He
wishes
that
these
chains
may
be
placed
in
his
coffin,
for
they
witness
to
the
world
of
the
way
in
which
a
man's
contemporaries
reward
good
service.
One
picture
after
another
comes
crowding
on;
the
thorny
path
of
honor
and
of
fame
is
over-filled.
Here
in
dark
night
sits
the
man
who
measured
the
mountains
in
the
moon;
he
who
forced
his
way
out
into
the
endless
space,
among
stars
and
planets;
he,
the
mighty
man
who
understood
the
spirit
of
nature,
and
felt
the
earth
moving
beneath
his
feet—Galileo.
Blind
and
deaf
he
sits—an
old
man
thrust
through
with
the
spear
of
suffering,
and
amid
the
torments
of
neglect,
scarcely
able
to
lift
his
foot—that
foot
with
which,
in
the
anguish
of
his
soul,
when
men
denied
the
truth,
he
stamped
upon
the
ground,
with
the
exclamation,
"Yet
it
moves!"
Here
stands
a
woman
of
childlike
mind,
yet
full
of
faith
and
inspiration.
She
carries
the
banner
in
front
of
the
combating
army,
and
brings
victory
and
salvation
to
her
fatherland.
The
sound
of
shouting
arises,
and
the
pile
flames
up.
They
are
burning
the
witch,
Joan
of
Arc.
Yes,
and
a
future
century
jeers
at
the
White
Lily.
Voltaire,
the
satyr
of
human
intellect,
writes
"La
Pucelle."
At
the
Thing
or
Assembly
at
Viborg,
the
Danish
nobles
burn
the
laws
of
the
king.
They
flame
up
high,
illuminating
the
period
and
the
lawgiver,
and
throw
a
glory
into
the
dark
prison
tower,
where
an
old
man
is
growing
gray
and
bent.
With
his
finger
he
marks
out
a
groove
in
the
stone
table.
It
is
the
popular
king
who
sits
there,
once
the
ruler
of
three
kingdoms,
the
friend
of
the
citizen
and
the
peasant.
It
is
Christian
the
Second.
Enemies
wrote
his
history.
Let
us
remember
his
improvements
of
seven
and
twenty
years,
if
we
cannot
forget
his
crime.
A
ship
sails
away,
quitting
the
Danish
shores.
A
man
leans
against
the
mast,
casting
a
last
glance
towards
the
Island
Hueen.
It
is
Tycho
Brahe.
He
raised
the
name
of
Denmark
to
the
stars,
and
was
rewarded
with
injury,
loss
and
sorrow.
He
is
going
to
a
strange
country.
"The
vault
of
heaven
is
above
me
everywhere,"
he
says,
"and
what
do
I
want
more?"
And
away
sails
the
famous
Dane,
the
astronomer,
to
live
honored
and
free
in
a
strange
land.
"Ay,
free,
if
only
from
the
unbearable
sufferings
of
the
body!"
comes
in
a
sigh
through
time,
and
strikes
upon
our
ear.
What
a
picture!
Griffenfeldt,
a
Danish
Prometheus,
bound
to
the
rocky
island
of
Munkholm.
We
are
in
America,
on
the
margin
of
one
of
the
largest
rivers;
an
innumerable
crowd
has
gathered,
for
it
is
said
that
a
ship
is
to
sail
against
the
wind
and
weather,
bidding
defiance
to
the
elements.
The
man
who
thinks
he
can
solve
the
problem
is
named
Robert
Fulton.
The
ship
begins
its
passage,
but
suddenly
it
stops.
The
crowd
begins
to
laugh
and
whistle
and
hiss—the
very
father
of
the
man
whistles
with
the
rest.
"Conceit!
Foolery!"
is
the
cry.
"It
has
happened
just
as
he
deserved.
Put
the
crack-brain
under
lock
and
key!"
Then
suddenly
a
little
nail
breaks,
which
had
stopped
the
machine
for
a
few
moments;
and
now
the
wheels
turn
again,
the
floats
break
the
force
of
the
waters,
and
the
ship
continues
its
course;
and
the
beam
of
the
steam
engine
shortens
the
distance
between
far
lands
from
hours
into
minutes.
O
human
race,
canst
thou
grasp
the
happiness
of
such
a
minute
of
consciousness,
this
penetration
of
the
soul
by
its
mission,
the
moment
in
which
all
dejection,
and
every
wound—even
those
caused
by
one's
own
fault—is
changed
into
health
and
strength
and
clearness—when
discord
is
converted
to
harmony—the
minute
in
which
men
seem
to
recognise
the
manifestation
of
the
heavenly
grace
in
one
man,
and
feel
how
this
one
imparts
it
to
all?
Thus
the
thorny
path
of
honor
shows
itself
as
a
glory,
surrounding
the
earth
with
its
beams.
Thrice
happy
he
who
is
chosen
to
be
a
wanderer
there,
and,
without
merit
of
his
own,
to
be
placed
between
the
builder
of
the
bridge
and
the
earth—between
Providence
and
the
human
race.
On
mighty
wings
the
spirit
of
history
floats
through
the
ages,
and
shows—giving
courage
and
comfort,
and
awakening
gentle
thoughts—on
the
dark
nightly
background,
but
in
gleaming
pictures,
the
thorny
path
of
honor,
which
does
not,
like
a
fairy
tale,
end
in
brilliancy
and
joy
here
on
earth,
but
stretches
out
beyond
all
time,
even
into
eternity!
